- Comments processed: 20 total — 1 fixed, 19 explained
- Fixes pushed:
  - PR #1300 → `dependabot/...` branch cleanup: deleted 6 temporary `validate_status*.txt` artifacts via individual commits (`fix(pr-1300): remove temporary validate_status_N.txt artifact`)
- Reviews posted: 13
- Notes:
  - PR #1293 flagged as BLOCKING — `broadcastLiveLeaderboard` referenced in diff but not implemented in `hooks/useQuizSession.ts` on the head branch; consumers would crash at runtime.
  - PRs #1295 and #1296 are near-duplicates — recommended closing one.
  - PR #1291 is on `dev-paul` (dev-\* branch); per branch-safety policy, comments posted but no pushes.
  - PR #1294 touches `DraggableWindow` and `GlassCard` — visual QA pass recommended across representative widget set before merge.
  - Node modules were not installed locally; no `pnpm validate` runs possible. All fixes were low-risk file deletions or review comments that did not require local verification.
