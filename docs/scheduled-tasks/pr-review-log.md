## 2026-06-12

- PRs reviewed: 12 (all open PRs; one head is `dev-paul` — read-only, review-only)
  - #1953 — refactor(admin-config): extract shared `isCardOpacity` guard (head `scheduled-tasks`, base `dev-paul`)
  - #1952 — docs(debugger): nightly run 15 log (head `nightly/debugger-log-2026-06-12`, base `dev-paul`)
  - #1951 — fix(i18n): replace EN-placeholder strings in boardsModal/shareCollection (DE/ES/FR) (head `nightly/admin-config-2026-06-12`, base `dev-paul`)
  - #1950 — fix(state): gradeAnswer partial-credit `isCorrect` consistency (head `nightly/state-data-2026-06-12`, base `dev-paul`)
  - #1949 — fix(layout): typing-field guard on Ctrl+/ cheat-sheet shortcut (head `nightly/dashboard-layout-2026-06-12`, base `dev-paul`)
  - #1948 — fix(docs): format unifier.md to pass Prettier (head `nightly/build-tooling-2026-06-12`, base `dev-paul`)
  - #1947 — fix(widgets): correct negative-range fraction label on NumberLine (head `nightly/widgets-2026-06-12`, base `dev-paul`)
  - #1946 — fix(docs): restore Prettier formatting on unifier.md (head `nightly/unifier-baseline-fix-2026-06-12`, base `dev-paul`)
  - #1945 — docs(unifier): run 14 memory log (head `nightly/unifier-log-2026-06-12`, base `dev-paul`)
  - #1944 — fix(guided-learning): address PR #1943 review feedback (head `claude/serene-meitner-eagi8c`, base `dev-paul`)
  - #1943 — Enhance Guided Learning editor with media upload/playback (head `dev-paul`, base `main` — read-only)
- Comments processed: 11 total — 8 fixed, 3 already-addressed/no-op
  - #1944: 4 gemini threads — 3 FIXED (HIGH: NaN-sanitize `trim.start`/`end` centrally in `clampTrimStart`/`clampTrimEnd` so `video.currentTime` can't be assigned NaN; MEDIUM: sync `onClose` ref in render body instead of `useLayoutEffect`; MEDIUM: drop now-unused `useLayoutEffect` import). 1 outdated thread skipped. Note: the suggested `react-hooks/refs` disable was _not_ needed — the rule doesn't flag this assignment (unused-directive under `--max-warnings 0`).
  - #1951: 1 gemini thread (MEDIUM) — FIXED. `fr.json` `pinnedEmpty` had Cyrillic `инг` in `Épингlez`; corrected to Latin `Épinglez`. Scanned all four locales for Cyrillic-block chars — none remaining.
  - #1950: 1 gemini thread (MEDIUM) — FIXED. `isCorrect = pointsEarned >= max` marked every answer correct for a 0-point question (`0 >= 0`) and used float comparison; switched to `matched === total` (equivalent for `max > 0`, correct for `max === 0`) + added a 0-point regression test.
  - #1949: 1 gemini thread (MEDIUM) — FIXED. Extracted the duplicated input/textarea/select/contentEditable check into a file-level `isTypingFieldActive()` helper and applied it to all six keydown guard sites.
  - #1947: 3 gemini threads (MEDIUM) — FIXED. Simplified the negative-tick fraction expr to `Math.abs(valNumer) % denom` (distinct from the `Math.abs(valNumer % denom)` band-aid the PR rejected — keeps `% denom`); corrected two test descriptions (`-1 3/4` is first sub-tick _above -2_; `fractionLabel` renders `2/4`, not `1/2`).
  - #1943: 7 threads — all already addressed via #1944 (author replies on each thread). No action.
  - #1953, #1952, #1948, #1946, #1945: no review comments.
- Fixes pushed: 5 (each to its own PR head branch — no pushes to `main`/`dev-*`)
  - #1944 / `claude/serene-meitner-eagi8c` — `fix(pr-1944): sanitize non-finite video trim values and sync onClose ref in render body`; type-check ✓ lint ✓ tests ✓ (5/5).
  - #1951 / `nightly/admin-config-2026-06-12` — `fix(pr-1951): replace Cyrillic characters in fr.json pinnedEmpty`; JSON ✓ prettier ✓ i18n tests ✓ (156/156).
  - #1950 / `nightly/state-data-2026-06-12` — `fix(pr-1950): derive matching isCorrect from matched===total`; type-check ✓ lint ✓ tests ✓ (13/13).
  - #1949 / `nightly/dashboard-layout-2026-06-12` — `fix(pr-1949): extract isTypingFieldActive helper`; type-check ✓ lint ✓ tests ✓ (25/25).
  - #1947 / `nightly/widgets-2026-06-12` — `fix(pr-1947): simplify negative-tick fraction expr and correct test descriptions`; type-check ✓ lint ✓ tests ✓ (16/16).
- Reviews posted: 12 (one structured `## Automated Code Review` per PR)
  - #1953 Ready; #1952 Ready; #1951 Ready (Cyrillic fix pushed); #1950 Ready (0-point fix pushed); #1949 Ready (helper extraction pushed); #1948 Ready (dup of #1946); #1947 Ready (simplification pushed); #1946 Ready (dup of #1948); #1945 Ready; #1944 Ready (all threads resolved); #1943 **Needs changes** (CI red — see below).
- Notes:
  - Branch-safety: #1943 head is `dev-paul` (matches `dev-*`) → read-only, review-only, no push. All other heads (`nightly/*`, `claude/*`, `scheduled-tasks`) are pushable; 5 fixes went to their own head branches. No pushes to `main` or `dev-paul`.
  - **#1943 CI is red** but only on `format:check` for `docs/routines/unifier.md` (Prettier drift) — all other jobs (type-check, Unit, E2E, Build, Firestore Rules, CodeQL) pass. This is exactly what **#1946**/**#1948** fix; landing one into dev-paul and re-running #1943's CI clears it. The 7 inline review threads on #1943 are already handled via #1944.
  - **Duplicate Prettier fix flagged:** #1946 (run-14 baseline-fix branch) and #1948 (run-15 build-tooling branch) carry the _identical_ reformat of `docs/routines/unifier.md`. Only one is needed — merge one and the other becomes empty/conflicting. #1945 also edits the same file (run-14 log content) and will need a trivial merge-order reconciliation.
  - Forward note: #1952's new "partial-credit `isCorrect` invariant" gotcha documents `pointsEarned >= pointsMax`; #1950 was refined to `matched === total` (handles the `max === 0` case). Worth syncing the gotcha wording when convenient.

## 2026-06-11

- PRs reviewed: 10 (all open PRs; every head is non-`main`/non-`dev-*`, so all in scope; all base `dev-paul`)
  - #1942 — docs(unifier): run 13 memory log (head `nightly/unifier-log-2026-06-11`)
  - #1941 — D4: convert tests/ relative imports to `@/` alias (head `nightly/unify-import-paths-tests-2026-06-11`)
  - #1940 — chore(perf): refresh performance baselines (head `nightly/perf-baseline-2026-06-11`)
  - #1939 — fix(layout): remove duplicate Alt+Delete handler from DraggableWindow (head `nightly/dashboard-layout-2026-06-11`)
  - #1938 — docs(debugger): nightly run 14 log (head `nightly/debugger-log-2026-06-11`)
  - #1937 — fix(functions): maxRedirects:0 SSRF guard in checkUrlCompatibility (head `nightly/build-tooling-2026-06-11`)
  - #1936 — fix(i18n): boardBreadcrumb/collectionSwitcher DE/ES/FR placeholders (head `nightly/admin-config-2026-06-11`)
  - #1935 — fix(state): dedup questions in classroomGradePush currentTotal (head `nightly/state-data-2026-06-11`)
  - #1934 — fix(BreathingWidget): phase==='ready' sentinel for Reset disabled (head `nightly/widgets-2026-06-11`)
  - #1933 — chore(scheduled-tasks): audit journals + activity-wall building defaults (head `scheduled-tasks`)
- Comments processed: 9 total — 7 fixed, 2 explained
  - #1939: 1 HIGH gemini thread — removing the `DraggableWindow` Alt+Backspace branch left `Alt+Backspace` unhandled because `DashboardView` only matched `Delete` → FIXED (global handler now clears on Delete+Backspace under Alt/Shift; plain Backspace stays a no-op).
  - #1936: 5 threads (3 HIGH stale `.root` keys in DE/ES/FR + 2 MEDIUM redundant test casts) → all 5 FIXED (translated `.root` to match the `"No Collection"` EN source, removed casts, extended the regression test to guard `.root`).
  - #1938: 1 MEDIUM gemini thread — duplicate `normalizeSession` backlog row → FIXED (removed; already tracked on the 06-08/06-09 rows).
  - #1942: 1 MEDIUM gemini thread (outdated) — Run Log PR-number column → EXPLAINED (no fix): committed table already has the PR in its own 5th column.
  - #1933: 1 MEDIUM gemini thread (outdated) — 64-vs-63 widget-count discrepancy → EXPLAINED (no fix): reviewer's own guidance is not to auto-reconcile historical audit logs; the PR itself reconciles it with an explicit awk verification.
  - #1940, #1941, #1935, #1934, #1937: no review comments.
- Fixes pushed: 3
  - #1939 / `nightly/dashboard-layout-2026-06-11` — restored Alt/Shift+Backspace clear-board in DashboardView; type-check ✓ lint ✓ tests ✓ (28/28).
  - #1936 / `nightly/admin-config-2026-06-11` — translated `.root` keys (Keine Sammlung / Sin colección / Aucune collection), dropped redundant test casts, extended regression test; type-check ✓ lint ✓ format ✓ tests ✓ (20/20).
  - #1938 / `nightly/debugger-log-2026-06-11` — removed duplicate backlog row (doc-only).
- Reviews posted: 10 (one structured review per PR)
  - #1942: Ready — doc-only unifier run 13 log; outdated table nit already resolved.
  - #1941: Ready — `@/` alias substitution; behavior-preserving (one bonus double-mock cleanup in escapeInteraction.test.tsx).
  - #1940: Ready with minor notes — baseline refresh is more than timing-only: `dashboard-baseline.json` `totalShellRenders` (a deterministic primary metric) dropped across nearly every scenario (the DashboardContext-split win); recommended correcting the PR body.
  - #1939: Ready — handler-ownership consolidation; the Alt+Backspace gap raised in review is fixed.
  - #1938: Ready — doc-only debugger run 14 log; duplicate backlog row removed.
  - #1937: Ready — genuine SSRF redirect-bypass fix mirroring fetchExternalProxy; good test.
  - #1936: Ready — locale placeholder fix + parity-enforcing test; all gemini follow-ups addressed.
  - #1935: Ready — Set-based dedup fence matching 5 prior fixes; well-tested.
  - #1934: Ready — phase sentinel for Reset disable; one-line + regression test.
  - #1933: Ready — high-quality activity-wall building-defaults wiring (pure validated helper + 8 tests); journal updates doc-only.
- Notes:
  - Branch-safety: all 10 head branches are non-`main`/non-`dev-*` → pushable; 3 required fix pushes.
  - #1933 head is `scheduled-tasks` (this log's branch); appending today's entry here and pushing follows the POST-TASK workflow.

## 2026-06-10

- PRs reviewed: 12 (all open PRs; no head is `main`/`dev-*`, so all in scope)
  - #1931 — perf(dashboard): DashboardContext split (head `perf/dashboard-context-split`, base `perf/dashboard-canvas-pass`)
  - #1930 — test(hooks): cover useVideoActivitySessionTeacher (head `add-video-activity-session-teacher-tests`, base `dev-paul`)
  - #1929 — audit(wednesday): daily/weekly audits 2026-06-10 (head `scheduled-tasks`, base `main`)
  - #1928 — fix(stores): `?? null` on contextId/contextTitle/resourceLinkId (head `nightly/build-tooling-2026-06-10`, base `dev-paul`)
  - #1927 — fix(i18n): widgets.seatingChart for DE/ES/FR (head `nightly/admin-config-2026-06-10`, base `dev-paul`)
  - #1926 — fix(export): first-occurrence answer dedup in buildResultsSheetData (head `nightly/state-data-2026-06-10`, base `dev-paul`)
  - #1925 — fix(DashboardView): guard groupBuildMode Escape vs typing fields (head `nightly/dashboard-layout-2026-06-10`, base `dev-paul`)
  - #1924 — chore(perf): refresh baseline.json (head `nightly/perf-baseline-2026-06-10`, base `dev-paul`)
  - #1923 — perf(dashboard): canvas perf pass + ruler (head `perf/dashboard-canvas-pass`, base `dev-paul`)
  - #1922 — docs(unifier): run 11 log 2026-06-10 (head `nightly/unifier-log-2026-06-10`, base `dev-paul`)
  - #1915 — chore(debugger): run 13 log 2026-06-09 (head `nightly/debugger-log-2026-06-09`, base `dev-paul`)
  - #1910 — docs(unifier): run 11 log 2026-06-09 (head `nightly/unifier-log-2026-06-09`, base `dev-paul`)
- Comments processed: 6 total — 3 fixed, 3 explained (all from gemini-code-assist)
  - #1923: 2 threads — FIXED. `minimizeAllWidgets`/`restoreAllWidgets` now read `activeIdRef.current` and drop `activeId` from deps for reference stability. Also converted the `if (!activeId) return` early-return guards in both (the suggestion only showed the `d.id` line; leaving the guard on the closure while removing the dep would have made it stale). `activeIdRef.current` is render-body-synced. type-check ✓ lint ✓ tests ✓.
  - #1926: 1 thread — FIXED. Added `const answers = r.answers ?? []` nullish guard before the dedup loop and switched the map value type to `R['answers'][number]`. type-check ✓ lint ✓ tests ✓ (17/17).
  - #1931: 1 thread — EXPLAINED. gemini's `lastCommittedState` notify-bailout is a sound, low-risk optimization but changes the brand-new store's notify semantics in a concurrent-rendering-sensitive path; recommended to the author but not auto-applied (design call, not a correctness defect).
  - #1925: 1 thread — EXPLAINED. Test-cleanup hardening (centralize element disposal in `afterEach`) is an enhancement; suite passes 21/21 and the suggestion is a wholesale `describe` rewrite, not a targeted fix.
  - #1924: 1 thread — EXPLAINED. Reverting durations to 3-run medians while surgically updating only the `gl.type25` commit count is a baseline-methodology decision that would undo the PR's stated purpose; left to the author.
  - #1930, #1929, #1928, #1927, #1922, #1915, #1910: no review comments.
- Fixes pushed: 2 (each to its own PR head branch — no pushes to `main`/`dev-*`)
  - #1923 / `perf/dashboard-canvas-pass` — `fix(pr-1923): make minimizeAllWidgets/restoreAllWidgets reference-stable`
  - #1926 / `nightly/state-data-2026-06-10` — `fix(pr-1926): guard answers iteration with ?? [] and use R['answers'][number]`
- Reviews posted: 12 (all COMMENT event)
  - #1931 Ready w/ notes (stacked on #1923 — merge that first; adopt notify bailout); #1930 Ready (test-only, faithful wiring; flagged VA's non-filtering of empty classIds/rosterIds as a possible follow-up); #1929 **Needs changes** (described "audit-only" but diff vs base `main` carries ~4,000+ lines of source — GuidedLearningEditor +1083, new ScreenCaptureModal +464, VideoActivityEditor +463, Quiz/VA editor modals, workflow files — `scheduled-tasks` has diverged from `main`; reconcile base/scope before merging to `main`); #1928 Ready; #1927 Ready; #1926 Ready (defensive guard pushed); #1925 Ready w/ notes (test-cleanup hardening deferred); #1924 Ready w/ notes (single-run snapshot noise); #1923 Ready w/ notes (ref-stability pushed; base of #1931); #1922 Ready w/ notes (run-11 unifier.md collides with #1910); #1915 Ready; #1910 Ready w/ notes (duplicate run-11 of unifier.md, collides with #1922).
- Notes:
  - Branch-safety: no open PR head is `main` or `dev-*`; all heads pushable. Both fixes went to PR head branches. No pushes to `main` or `dev-paul`. This log committed to `scheduled-tasks` (fair-game) per task instructions.
  - **#1929 scope discrepancy (flag for human):** the audit PR's base is `main` and `scheduled-tasks` is far ahead of it, so the PR would land a large editor refactor into production `main`. Either retarget to `dev-paul` or re-sync `scheduled-tasks` to `main`. (This log commit rides on that same branch but is docs-only.)
  - **Duplicate run-11 unifier logs:** #1910 (2026-06-09) and #1922 (2026-06-10) both bump `docs/routines/unifier.md` to "Run count: 11" and edit overlapping rows → conflict on second merge; flagged on both.
  - #1929 journals also surface a real Firestore **MEDIUM** (`pollVotes` subcollection writes unrestricted for all authenticated users) worth a dedicated `firestore.rules` fix PR.
  - #1923 touches `context/DashboardContext.tsx` heavily but identity-preserving; #1931 adds a new `dashboardCanvasStore.ts` with conditional-`use()` fallback so the ~185 `useDashboard()` consumers are untouched. No new `WidgetType`/`WidgetRegistry.ts` config-merge or `firestore.rules` match-block changes in the code-bearing PRs, so those checks were not triggered.

- Comments processed: 11 total — 10 fixed, 1 explained (all from gemini-code-assist)
  - #1905: 3 threads — FIXED. Import `afterEach`, add `afterEach(vi.restoreAllMocks())`, drop manual `consoleSpy.mockRestore()`. lint ✓ tests ✓ (21/21).
  - #1902: 2 threads — FIXED. Removed redundant `as never` / `as { … }` casts in the normalize test; fields are declared optionals on `VideoActivitySession`, sessionOptions now uses real `VideoActivitySessionOptions` fields. type-check ✓ tests ✓ (19/19).
  - #1901: 2 threads — FIXED. Dropped redundant `P`/`Nav` suffixes on block-scoped `activeEl`/`isTypingField` guard vars. type-check ✓ lint ✓ tests ✓ (10/10).
  - #1900: 2 threads — FIXED. German `Tafel-Daten`→`Tafeldaten` (compound noun) and `inherit` `Übernehmen`→`Vom Board` (avoids "Apply" ambiguity). prettier ✓ i18n tests ✓ (35/35).
  - #1899: 1 thread — FIXED. Removed dead `displayMode === 'decimals'` no-op branch. type-check ✓ lint ✓ tests ✓ (6/6).
  - #1898: 1 thread — EXPLAINED, no fix. The suggested `AssignModal.tsx:23`/`ImportWizard.tsx:31` line numbers are wrong; verified the doc's existing `:24`/`:30` match the actual code. Suggested edit would introduce errors.
  - #1904, #1903, #1897, #1896, #1890, #1889: no review comments.
- Fixes pushed: 5 (each to its own PR head branch — no pushes to `main`/`dev-*`)
  - #1899 / `nightly/widgets-2026-06-08` — `fix(pr-1899): remove dead displayMode==='decimals' no-op branch`
  - #1905 / `scheduled-tasks` — `fix(pr-1905): add afterEach restoreAllMocks and remove manual mockRestore`

  - #1901 / `nightly/dashboard-layout-2026-06-08` — `fix(pr-1901): drop redundant P/Nav suffixes on block-scoped guard vars`
  - #1900 / `nightly/admin-config-2026-06-08` — `fix(pr-1900): correct German translations (Tafeldaten, inherit label)`
- Reviews posted: 12 (all COMMENT event)
  - #1905 Ready; #1904 Ready w/ notes (run-11 debugger.md overlaps #1896); #1903 Ready (contained LTI null-clobber fix); #1902 Ready; #1901 Ready; #1900 Ready; #1899 Ready; #1898 Ready w/ notes (run-10 unifier.md overlaps #1890; wrong line-number nit declined); #1897 Ready w/ notes (DUPLICATE of #1889 — merge one); #1896 Ready w/ notes (overlaps #1904); #1890 Ready w/ notes (overlaps #1898; tracks dup #1889); #1889 Needs changes (superseded by more-complete #1897).
- Notes:
  - Branch-safety: no open PR head is `main` or `dev-*`; all heads pushable. All 5 fixes went to PR head branches. No pushes to `main`.
  - **Duplicate-PR cluster flagged:** #1889 and #1897 make the identical `utils/`→`@/` conversion (#1897 also converts the `FONTS` import; more complete). Their memory-log PRs (#1890 ↔ #1898, both "run 10") and the debugger logs (#1896 ↔ #1904, both "run 11") similarly overlap and will conflict on second merge. Recommended in reviews that the team land one of each pair.
  - #1903 touches `functions/src/lti/nrpsStore.ts` — additive title-preservation logic only; `persistLtiLaunchContext` signature unchanged. No new `WidgetType`, no `WidgetRegistry.ts`/`DashboardContext.tsx` config-merge, no `firestore.rules` changes across the batch, so widget-registration and rules-match-block checks were not triggered.

- Comments processed: 1 total — 1 fixed, 0 explained
  - #1894: 1 unresolved thread (gemini-code-assist) — FIXED. The new regression test called `setupMocks()` _after_ setting `useImageUpload`'s `fnA` return value; since `setupMocks()` re-mocks `useImageUpload` with a fresh `vi.fn()`, it silently clobbered `fnA` so the first render never used it. Reordered `setupMocks()` ahead of the `fnA` mock. type-check ✓ lint ✓ tests ✓ (5/5 in Dock.test.tsx). Replied and resolved the thread.
  - #1887: 1 thread already resolved (NextUp maxWidth `30cqmin` fix from 2026-06-06) — no action.
  - All other PRs: no review comments.

  - #1896 Ready (docs); #1895 Ready; #1894 Ready (test-ordering fix pushed); #1893 Ready; #1892 Ready; #1891 Ready; #1890 Ready (docs); #1889 Ready (mechanical @/ alias); #1888 Ready (verified ScaledEmptyState + Music already imported); #1887 Ready with minor notes (css-scaling.md Completed entry still records the superseded `min(120px, 30cqmin)` value — doc-only).
- Notes:
  - Branch-safety: no open PR head is `main` or `dev-*`; all heads were pushable. The single fix went to its PR head branch (`nightly/dashboard-2026-06-07`). No pushes to `main`.
  - All 9 nightly PRs are small, focused bug/i18n/refactor/doc changes; none add a new `WidgetType` or touch `WidgetRegistry.ts`/`DashboardContext.tsx` config-merge/`firestore.rules`, so the widget-registration and rules-match-block checks were not triggered. #1891 touches `functions/src/index.ts` (two additive `if` statements — no signature change) and #1887 touches `types.ts`/`utils/adminBuildingConfig.ts` (comment-only).

- Comments processed: 2 threads — 2 fixed, 0 explained
  - #1887: 1 thread — FIXED. gemini-code-assist correctly noted `maxWidth: 'min(120px, 30cqmin)'` still hard-caps at 120px (since `min()` picks the smaller value), defeating the PR's scaling goal. Changed to `maxWidth: '30cqmin'` so the session name scales with the widget. type-check ✓ lint ✓ format ✓.
  - #1886: 1 thread — FIXED. Removed the duplicate "D4 hooks/ complete (run 9)" note, keeping the more detailed entry (the one noting the `useImageUpload.ts` Prettier fix). Did NOT apply gemini's literal suggestion text, which would have duplicated the adjacent "D4 context/ complete (run 8)" line; removed the redundant line instead. format ✓.
  - #1885, #1884, #1883: no review comments.
- Fixes pushed: 2
  - #1887 / `scheduled-tasks` — commit `fbe309b` `fix(pr-1887): use 30cqmin directly for NextUp session-name maxWidth`.
  - #1886 / `nightly/unifier-log-2026-06-06` — commit `9c0ba4c` `fix(pr-1886): remove duplicate D4 hooks/ run-9 note in unifier log`.
- Reviews posted: 5 (all COMMENT event)
  - #1887 Ready w/ minor notes (css-scaling.md Completed entry still records the superseded `min(120px, 30cqmin)` value — doc-only); #1886 Ready; #1885 Ready (verified `SettingsLabel` `icon?` prop signature; `Settings2` still used); #1884 Ready (mechanical `@/` alias, `./` sibling imports untouched); #1883 Ready (verified `ScaledEmptyState` requires `icon`+`title`; usage correct).
- Notes:
  - Branch-safety: no open PR head is `main` or `dev-*`; all heads were pushable. Both fixes went to their respective PR head branches (`scheduled-tasks` for #1887, `nightly/unifier-log-2026-06-06` for #1886). No pushes to `main`.
  - Verified component signatures before reviewing: `components/common/SettingsLabel.tsx` (optional `icon` rendered at `w-3 h-3`, label `mb-2`) and `components/common/ScaledEmptyState.tsx` (`icon` + `title` required, `subtitle` optional, default icon color `text-slate-300`). Both #1885 and #1883 use them correctly.
  - All five PRs are small, mechanical/doc-level changes — no new widgets, no `types.ts`/`WidgetRegistry.ts`/`DashboardContext.tsx`/Firestore-rules changes, so the widget-registration and rules-match-block checks were not triggered.

- Comments processed: 6 threads — 0 fixed, 6 explained
  - #1879: 1 thread — explained, no fix. gemini's `undefined`-property cleanup is unnecessary: feature config is saved via `FeaturePermissionsManager.savePermission` with a full-document `setDoc` (no `{ merge: true }`), so `ignoreUndefinedProperties` drops a `fontFamily: undefined` reset-to-Global correctly. Also matches the sibling Checklist/ConceptWeb panels.
  - #1876: 2 threads — explained, already addressed in `4bd04b2` (pluralized `modeChipAriaWithCount_*`/`triggerAriaWithAbsent_*` keys already present in test + all locales).
  - #1875: 1 thread (outdated) — explained, mocks already use the `@/` alias in HEAD (active, not inert).
  - #1874: 1 thread (outdated) — explained, the `newDurationSeconds === 0` else-branch is already present in HEAD (`useBreathing.ts:83–89`).
  - #1870: 1 thread — explained, no fix. MathTools grid column headers becoming orphan `<label>`s is a design tradeoff; `SettingsLabel` deliberately always renders `<label>` per its own documented rationale. Deferred to human/design owner; suggested an `as`/`role` escape hatch as the clean path.
  - #1864, #1861, #1838: inline threads already carried author "Fixed/Valid" replies (or are resolved) at HEAD — no action.
  - #1878, #1877, #1873, #1872, #1871, #1852: no review comments.
- Fixes pushed: 0 — every actionable comment was already addressed in a later commit, not-a-defect (evidence-backed), or a design tradeoff for human judgment. No branch pushes this run other than this log update.
- Reviews posted: 14 (all COMMENT event)
  - #1879 Ready w/ minor notes (incidental scheduled-tasks journal-doc churn riding along); #1878 Ready; #1877 Ready; #1876 Ready (native DE/ES/FR copy spot-check suggested); #1875 Ready; #1874 Ready; #1873 Ready; #1872 Ready w/ minor notes (run-8 ledger dup vs #1852); #1871 Ready; #1870 Ready w/ minor notes (a11y thread deferred); #1864 Ready w/ minor notes (changelog overlap w/ #1861); #1861 Ready w/ minor notes (overlap w/ #1864); #1852 Ready w/ minor notes (superseded by #1872); #1838 Ready w/ minor notes (author-flagged live Classroom smoke test).
- Notes:
  - Branch-safety: no open PR head is `main` or `dev-*`; all branches were pushable. No fixes required pushing this run. No pushes to `main`.
  - Cross-PR coordination flagged for humans: (1) #1864 and #1861 both add a 2026-06-04 entry to `public/changelog.json` → `dev-paul` (conflict/duplicate risk — reconcile or sequence); (2) #1852 (06-04) and #1872 (06-05) are both "run 8" `docs/routines/unifier.md` updates → `dev-paul` (#1872 supersedes #1852); (3) #1879's diff carries accumulated `docs/scheduled-tasks/*.md` journal updates beyond the Stations feature.
  - CI status was not surfaced via the commit-status API (`total_count: 0` on all heads — these branches validate through GitHub Actions check_runs, not legacy statuses); merge-readiness is based on diff review + each PR's stated `pnpm run validate` result rather than an independently re-run CI.

- Comments processed: 13 total — 1 fixed, 12 explained
  - #1856: 1 thread — FIXED. Spanish gender agreement `noBentoBox` `listado` → `listada` (agrees with feminine _caja_).
  - #1859: 9 threads — explained, no fix. 5 `e.target?.value` optional-chaining nitpicks declined (repo uses plain `e.target.value` in ~566 handlers, 0 optional; `e.target` non-null in React onChange). 2 already-implemented (`toStandardHex`, bare-hex `#` prepend present at HEAD). 2 outdated (scaleMultiplier validation/test, lines gone from current diff).
  - #1854: 1 thread — explained, no fix. Listener `beforeEach`/`afterEach` refactor is out-of-scope test hygiene; tests pass, jsdom torn down per file.
  - #1850: 2 threads — explained, no fix. `useId`/`htmlFor` a11y is a valid but pre-existing gap (base markup was already orphaned `<label>`s); out of scope for a mechanical behavior-preserving refactor.
  - #1838, #1847: all inline threads already carried author "Fixed/Valid" replies at HEAD — no action.
  - #1858, #1857, #1855, #1853, #1852, #1851, #1849: no review comments.
- Fixes pushed: 1
  - #1856 — branch `nightly/admin-config-2026-06-04` — corrected Spanish `noBentoBox` participle to `listada`; verified Prettier + full i18n suite (132 tests) green before push.
- Reviews posted: 13 (all COMMENT event)
  - #1859 Ready w/ minor notes; #1858 Ready; #1857 Ready; #1856 Ready (pushed gender fix); #1855 Ready; #1854 Ready; #1853 Ready; #1852 Ready; #1851 Ready; #1850 Ready w/ minor notes; #1849 Ready w/ minor notes (changelog version-ordering vs #1847; base is `main`); #1847 Ready w/ minor notes (coordinate version ordering with #1849); #1838 Ready w/ minor notes (author-flagged live Classroom smoke test).
- Notes:
  - Branch-safety: no open PR head is `main` or `dev-*`, so all branches were pushable. Only #1856 needed a fix; the rest were explanation-only. No pushes to `main`. #1849 targets `main` as its base but the push (had there been one) would have been to its head `claude/vibrant-darwin-bHcj5`, not `main`.
  - Cross-PR coordination flagged for humans: #1847 (`2026.06.03.1`, base `dev-paul`) and #1849 (`2026.06.03.2`, base `main`) both prepend to `public/changelog.json` and describe overlapping Schoology work — version ordering / dedup needs a human decision.

  - #1814 (classroomAddonAuth.ts, gemini): **explained** — already addressed by the author in 066d873 (response-body drain added); thread left unresolved but fix is in.
  - #1815 (Results.tsx, gemini): **explained** — already addressed by the author in 8fcc0b8 (empty-session early return returns `avgScore: null`); thread left unresolved but fix is in.
  - #1824 (unifier.md, gemini): **explained** — the requested "2 instances at lines ~67, ~171" wording is already present on the branch (comment is outdated).
  - #1826 (AnnotationCanvas.tsx, gemini ×2): **fixed** — added a render-body-synced `drawingStateRef`; window pointerup/pointercancel listeners now read it and the effect deps reduce to `[isDrawing]`, so listeners register once per stroke (targeted `react-hooks/refs` disable, per #1802 precedent).
  - #1828 (de.json / fr.json / widgetStickersLocales.test.ts, gemini ×3): **fixed** — added `filterAll`/`filterFavorites`/`filterMine`/`reorganizeSticker`/`favoriteSticker` to all four locales and to `REQUIRED_WIDGET_STICKERS_KEYS`.
  - #1829 (organizationInvites.ts + .test.ts, gemini ×2): **fixed** — the dot-domain check now uses `indexOf('.', atIdx + 1) < atIdx + 2`, rejecting `user@.co.uk`; extended the regression test.
  - #1830 (debugger.md, gemini ×2): **fixed** — escaped the absolute-value pipes (`\|...\|`) and restored the table to 4 columns.
  - #1831 (ai-integration.md, gemini): **fixed** — corrected the client caller name to `recommendVideoForActivity`.

  - #1830 / `nightly/debugger-log-2026-06-03` — escape pipes in NumberLine epsilon-guard log entry, restore 4-column table.
  - #1826 / `nightly/dashboard-layout-2026-06-03` — sync drawing state via ref so window listeners register once per stroke.
  - #1831 / `scheduled-tasks` — correct ai-integration.md caller name to `recommendVideoForActivity` (this commit).
  - (Each fix verified: type-check ✓ lint ✓ tests ✓ / format-check ✓ for doc-only changes.)
- Reviews posted: 17 (one structured review per open PR)
  - Notable: #1821 (Schoology LTI) — Ready with notes; no blocking issues found in the JWT/rules surfaces reviewed (RS256 pinned, all secret LTI collections server-only, dedicated rules test), but recommended a human security sign-off given size + LTI/OIDC/grade-writeback sensitivity. #1816 & #1814 both rewrite the `linkClassroomCourse` trust-anchor/transaction seam — flagged to confirm clean merge order. All other PRs assessed Ready or Ready-with-minor-notes.
- Notes:
  - Branch-safety: all 17 PR heads are feature/nightly/`scheduled-tasks` branches (none are `main` or `dev-*`), so all were pushable. Fixes pushed only to the respective PR head branches; no pushes to `main` or `dev-paul`.
  - This log + the #1831 doc fix are committed and pushed to `scheduled-tasks` per task instructions (it is a fair-game branch; pushing updates open PR #1831, which is the intended target of its own review-comment fix).

- Comments processed: 6 total — 3 fixed, 3 explained
  - #1800 (AddonShell.tsx, gemini): **fixed** — `AddonSelect` `onBlur` now guards `e.relatedTarget` for null before the `contains` check, so a non-focusable blur target (e.g. the dropdown scrollbar) no longer prematurely closes the popover.
  - #1800 (TeacherReviewRoute.tsx, gemini): **explained** — code already resets `quizData` to null when `quizId` is absent; the suggested `useSyncedState` hook is a new shared abstraction (architectural call) and the cross-quiz-transition case is an edge case for this single-session route.
  - #1801 (GuidedLearningPlayer.tsx, gemini): **fixed** — replaced the post-paint `useEffect` ref sync with a synchronous render-body assignment per CLAUDE.md, plus a targeted `react-hooks/refs` disable for the v7 false-positive.
  - #1802 (DraggableWindow.tsx, gemini): **fixed** — corrected the `shouldRenderSettings` latch comment to describe the actual `!shouldRenderSettings` guard instead of a nonexistent `prevFlipped` (comment-only).
  - #1804 (widgetWindowLocales.test.ts, gemini): **explained** — recursive full-parity refactor is a test-design enhancement that would broaden scope beyond the PR's 9 keys and risk surfacing unrelated pre-existing gaps; left for a human.
  - #1806 (debugger.md, gemini): **explained** — reviewer's `.values()` suggestion is incorrect; #1803 iterates `questionsById` directly with `[qId, q]` destructuring (≡ `.entries()`), so the existing wording is accurate.
- Fixes pushed: 3
  - #1800 / `claude/serene-meitner-EzK6N` — guard `AddonSelect` `onBlur` against null `relatedTarget` (type-check ✓ lint ✓).
  - #1801 / `nightly/widgets-2026-06-02` — sync `answeredStepsRef` in render body instead of `useEffect` (type-check ✓ lint ✓ tests ✓ 3946 pass).

- Reviews posted: 8 (one structured `## Automated Code Review` comment per PR above)
- Notes:
  - Branch-safety: no PR targets `main`; all eight head branches are non-`main`/non-`dev-*` and pushable. Pushes went only to the three PR head branches with actionable fixes. This log committed on `scheduled-tasks` per task instructions (not a `dev-*`/`main` branch).

- Notes:
  - Branch-safety: #1781 head `dev-paul` matches `dev-*` → treated read-only (review comment only, no push). All other heads (`nightly/*`, `claude/*`) are pushable. #1781's one prior inline thread was already author-resolved.
  - #1781 CI status reads `pending` (0 checks reported) on head SHA — flagged in the review to confirm green before merging to `main`.
  - `scheduled-tasks` is not the head of any open PR this run, so this log is committed and pushed to `scheduled-tasks` directly.

  - PR #1753 (`nightly/debugger-log-2026-05-29`) — commit `c5104b2` `fix(pr-1753): wrap DiceWidget identifier in backticks in debugger log`. Wrapped the `DiceWidget` identifier in backticks per gemini-code-assist suggestion; prettier rewrapped column padding in adjacent rows.
  - PR #1752 (`nightly/build-tooling-2026-05-29`) — commit `25eb17c` `fix(pr-1752): escape single-quote in sanitizePrompt for attribute-breakout defense`. Added `"'": '&#39;'` to `ESCAPE_MAP` and extended the regex character class; added a regression test asserting `it's → it&#39;s`. 7/7 tests pass.
  - PR #1748 (`nightly/unifier-log-2026-05-29`) — commit `99f7743` `fix(pr-1748): prefix admin paths with components/admin/ in D5 backlog table`. Prefixed `SaveAsTemplateModal.tsx` and `Organization/OrganizationPanel.tsx` with `components/admin/` to match the rest of the D5 table.

  - PR #1750 had a gemini suggestion to swap `TestConfig` for `TextConfig` in the new test file, claiming type-check would fail. Declined — `pnpm run type-check` exits clean; the explicit `as [Partial<TestConfig>]` cast on `mock.calls[0]` resolves the generic at the call site. Explained on the thread.

Drops the `mb-3` Tailwind-class-collision with the SettingsLabel default `mb-2`; adds `mb-0` on the two SettingsLabels inside flex-headers / `space-y-3` sections to preserve the original spacing. Verified: type-check ✓ lint ✓ prettier ✓.
  - PR #1724 (`nightly/unify-toast-routines-2026-05-28`) — commit `09d9bb0` `fix(pr-1724): wrap async saveRoutine in try/catch + guard nullable state`. Adds try/catch around `saveRoutine` so a Firestore/network error surfaces a toast and the modal stays open; adds `if (!editingRoutine) return;` and `if (!deleteConfirm) return;` guards inside the async closures. Verified: type-check ✓ lint ✓ prettier ✓.

  - PR #1730 (`nightly/build-tooling-2026-05-28`) — commit `e7b5c49` `fix(pr-1730): sanitizePrompt single-pass regex + lookup map`. Collapses the 8 chained `.replace()` calls into a single-pass `/[&<>{}[\]\`]/g`regex +`ESCAPE_MAP`lookup; functionally identical, inherently safer against re-evaluation of inserted`&`, one allocation instead of eight. Verified: type-check ✓ lint ✓ sanitize tests ✓ (5/5).
  - PR #1731 (`nightly/debugger-log-2026-05-28`) — commit `ee249f6` `fix(pr-1731): use full path components/widgets/Stations/nexus.ts in run log`. Updates the run-3 Widgets row to use the full repo-root path, matching the convention of other rows. Verified: prettier ✓.
  - PR #1732 (`claude/loving-bell-M4E0T`) — commit `63deb8e` `fix(pr-1732): validate fontFamily union + guard color picker against invalid hex`. Validates `raw.fontFamily` against the `GlobalFontFamily` union in `utils/adminBuildingConfig.ts` (was accepting any non-empty string); adds `isValidHex` helper to `NumberLineConfigurationPanel.tsx` so both color pickers no longer flicker to `#000000` when the adjacent text field has a partial/invalid hex. Added 19th test asserting unknown `fontFamily` strings are rejected. Verified: type-check ✓ lint ✓ prettier ✓ tests ✓ (19/19).
- Reviews posted: 13 (all open PRs received a structured review comment).
- Notes:
  - Branch safety: all 6 fixes were pushed to head branches of PRs targeting `dev-paul`. No push to `main` or `dev-paul`.
  - PR #1720 (`fix-quiz-data-loss`) had 6 review threads — all already resolved by the author in commits 2fbbdc9 / 615db37 / bbee53a before this run started; no automated fix needed.
  - PR #1727 (AnnotationCanvas) had 2 review comments suggesting a `hasPointerCapture` guard fallback and corresponding test mocks. Declined — the PR description explicitly evaluated and rejected this as a band-aid. Every browser this app supports (Chrome 90+, Edge 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+) implements pointer capture, so the guarded code path would never fire.
  - PR #1729 had a defensive `?? {}` test-guard suggestion — declined as a style preference; the current `toHaveProperty` matcher already produces a clear failure if the namespace is missing.
  - PR #1732 had a suggestion to swap the color inputs for `SurfaceColorSettings`. Declined — the panel intentionally uses a uniform plain-input visual style across font dropdown, opacity slider, number/select inputs, and color fields. A partial swap would create visual discontinuity; a whole-panel migration to shared appearance components is a separate scope.

  - Branch safety: pushed to nightly/admin-config-2026-05-27, nightly/build-tooling-2026-05-27, nightly/unify-toast-arch-2026-05-27-clean (all fair game). No push to `main` or `dev-paul`. PR #1702 (`dev-paul → main`) received review comment only — its two open threads already have author-replies pointing at #1703 fixes.
  - Cross-cutting bleed-through observation: PRs #1704, #1706, #1707, #1709 all carry the WorkSymbolsConfigurationModal.tsx diff from a shared base with #1708, which is why gemini-code-assist left the same race/async findings on each. Replied on each PR explaining the canonical fix lives in #1708 (commit d37b011) and no per-PR push is needed.
  - Declined refactor: the URL-API rewrite suggestion on #1711 was scoped much larger than the targeted YouTube playlist regression — would touch all 36 existing tests. Recommended a separate follow-up PR.
  - Declined wrapper on #1716: gemini suggested wrapping `updateConfig` to narrow the type. The reference pattern in `NeedDoPutThen/Settings.tsx` (whose config also lacks `scaleMultiplier`) passes a direct callback under strict type-check, and the `writeScaleMultiplier={false}` default prevents `scaleMultiplier` from ever being dispatched at runtime. Not changing the established pattern.

- Fixes pushed: 2
  - PR #1694 (`claude/loving-bell-LrmHy`) — commit `fa204a53` `fix(pr-1694): rephrase 'sole exception' wording in new-widget skill reference table`. Rephrased to "exception to the standard `Widget.tsx` convention" after verifying TimeToolWidget, ClassesWidget, BreathingWidget, ScheduleWidget, PdfWidget, RandomWidget, StickerBookWidget, and Catalyst widgets all deviate from the convention. Verified: `pnpm exec prettier --write` re-formatted table column widths.
  - dev-paul reviewer concerns (PR #1690 + #1691) — addressed via new PR **#1695** (`claude/pr-review-fixes-2026-05-26`) commit `b47ddeca` `fix(pr-1690,1691): harden QR DOMParser body access + admin clock format24 type check`. Two-line patch: `doc.body?.textContent` in `QRWidget/deriveSyncedUrl.ts:16` and `typeof raw.format24 === 'boolean'` in `utils/adminBuildingConfig.ts:141`. Verified: `pnpm type-check` ✓, `pnpm lint --max-warnings 0` ✓, `pnpm run format:check` ✓, 31 tests passed. Opened as a separate PR because direct pushes to `dev-paul` returned HTTP 403 from the automation proxy.
- Reviews posted: 6
  - PR #1685: Ready with minor notes — massive Phase 2 work, all 18 prior threads resolved, only known follow-up is the cross-user synced-drawing gap documented as TODO.
  - PR #1690: Ready with minor notes — rollup of #1684/#1687/#1688/#1689, two hardening fixes pulled into #1695, the `prefer-promise-reject-errors` disables preserve realistic Firestore rejection shapes in mock.
  - PR #1691: Ready with minor notes — single mechanical theme-color substitution; rebase on current dev-paul HEAD will collapse the apparent unrelated-changes diff.
  - PR #1692: Ready with minor notes — doc-only canon doc; same rebase-collapses-diff caveat as #1691.
  - PR #1693: Ready — standard Tuesday audit cadence; surfaced the new `qs` MEDIUM as worth tracking in the next functions/ dep sweep.
  - PR #1694: Ready — small but useful 404-link fix in the new-widget skill table.
- Notes:
  - Branch safety: pushed to `claude/loving-bell-LrmHy` (fair game) and new branch `claude/pr-review-fixes-2026-05-26` (fair game). Attempted direct push to `dev-paul` for #1690 hardening fixes; the proxy returned HTTP 403, so the fixes were rerouted through new PR #1695 against dev-paul. No pushes to `main` or `dev-paul` direct.
  - The "scope mismatch" comments on #1691 and #1692 turned out to be artifacts of both branches being created off an older dev-paul SHA — the PR diff appears to include #1684/#1687/#1688/#1689 file deltas because git renders them against the branch's older base. Rebasing on current dev-paul HEAD before merge will collapse each PR to its actual single-purpose change.
  - The `react-hooks/refs` rule the reviewers kept citing is not actually enabled in `eslint.config.js` (only `react-hooks/recommended` is). Verified by running `pnpm lint --max-warnings 0` clean on the current dev-paul HEAD with the DriveFileAttachment render-body ref pattern in place. The local disable in `hooks/useDebouncedCallback.ts` appears to be defensive rather than required.

- Reviews posted: 4
  - PR #1687 TimeTool RAF perf fix: Ready — root-cause fix splits the conflated tick + auto-trigger into two effects with the correct dep array for each concern; new regression tests cover both the perf bug and the closure-via-effect freshness invariant.
  - PR #1686 useEffect audit doc: Ready — doc-only, 9a2302d fixup commit reconciled the headline numbers (527 graded of 567 total) and corrected the DriveFileAttachment/DashboardView/BoardNavFab/MusicManager entries. Suggested nice-to-have: permalink the actionable D/C entries at audit-base SHA `8765c4f` for line-drift resilience.
  - PR #1685 Whiteboard Phase 2: Needs description update + Wave 8 + test-plan checkboxes — PR description still says "Wave 1 in progress / Waves 2-8 pending" but waves 1-7 have landed on this branch as separate per-wave commits; only Wave 8 (Firestore subcollection) remains. Branch also drags in the unmerged dev-paul backlog because it's based off main — confirm merge plan.
  - PR #1684 MiniApp toolbar + Clock building defaults: Ready with minor notes — both items well-scoped, all self-review feedback addressed (rounding + zero-guard in 8bf7759/ed08dbc, partial-validity tests, `Completed-pending-merge` journal convention). Manual visual-regression checkboxes in test plan still unticked.
- Notes:
  - Branch safety: 1 push to `claude/dev-paul-bug-perf-fix-1xnnH` (fair game per safety rule). No pushes to `main` or `dev-paul`.
  - The five `gemini-code-assist` comments on PR #1687 were all valid — `updateWidget` already shallow-merges via `context/DashboardContext.tsx:4470`, so the `...widget.config` spread was redundant and risked write-skew with the stale `activeDashboard` closure when timer-end triggers fire.

  - #1366 — docs: plan for repo-wide line-ending normalization (base `main`, head `docs/line-endings-normalization-plan`)
- Comments processed: 11 unresolved review threads across the four PRs — 0 fixed (none actionable), 11 already addressed/explained. PR #1672's five threads (Copilot `console.error`→`logError` + ungated poll; Gemini ×2 missing `isDefault: false`; Copilot stale-title) each already carry an author reply, with the three code fixes staged on #1674. PR #1366's six threads are all outdated/resolved across prior sweeps. PR #1674 and #1675 had no inline review comments.
- Fixes pushed: 0
  - No new code fixes were needed. The actionable #1672 feedback is already implemented on #1674 (verified the diff: explicit `isDefault: false` after `sanitizeBoardSnapshot`, `logError('DashboardContext.duplicateDashboard', …)`, and the quiz `useFocusLossPoll` gate `tabWarningsEnabled && session.status === 'active' && myResponse?.status !== 'completed'`). The `dev-paul` push permission was therefore not exercised.
- Reviews posted: 4
  - PR #1675 useActivityWallLibrary tests: Ready — 13 well-structured tests (listener wiring, snapshot mapping + sparse-doc defaults, empty-`classId` strip rule, signed-out throw paths) following the `usePlcNotes.test.ts` pattern; test-only + scheduled-task doc-log refresh, no production risk.
  - PR #1674 #1672 fix-up: Ready with minor notes — three correct, minimal fixes mapping 1:1 to the #1672 bot comments. Flagged merge ordering (must land in `dev-paul` with/before #1672) and a small gap (no test asserting the poll disables once `myResponse.status === 'completed'`).
  - PR #1672 Boards Duplicate + focus-loss: Ready with minor notes — all 14 CI checks green; `useFocusLossPoll` is well-designed and follows the useEffect-escape-hatch rule (latest-callback ref in render body, first-call-only seed surviving snapshot re-renders). Key note: this branch's own diff still carries the pre-fix code, so #1674 + the #1673 changelog must be sequenced into `dev-paul` alongside it.
  - PR #1366 line-endings plan: Ready — doc-only, all reviewer threads resolved; noted the PR has been open since 2026-04-21 and is itself the kind of open PR its execution preconditions require cleared, so it should be merged (inert until executed) or closed.
- Notes:
  - Branch safety: zero pushes to any PR branch this run (no actionable fixes). No push to `main`; `dev-paul` push permission not exercised.
  - #1672, #1674, and #1673 (changelog) form a merge set against `dev-paul` — sequencing them together is the main reviewer-flagged concern, since #1672 in isolation ships the bot feedback unaddressed.

## 2026-05-19

- PRs reviewed:
  - #1666 — fix(deps): override lodash-es to ^4.18.1 to close HIGH code-injection CVEs (base `dev-paul`, head `scheduled-tasks`, draft)
  - #1665 — feat(admin): personal-spotify global feature gate with building scoping (base `dev-paul`, head `feat/personal-spotify-gate`)
  - #1366 — docs: plan for repo-wide line-ending normalization (base `main`, head `docs/line-endings-normalization-plan`)
- Comments processed: 1 actionable unresolved review comment (PR #1666, gemini-code-assist proposing scope expansion to also override `flatted`/`ws`/`yaml`). PR #1665's six review threads are all already resolved. PR #1366's remaining `.editorconfig` proposal continues to be deferred (fourth sweep — still pending author decision).
- Fixes pushed: 0
  - PR #1666 gemini comment was a MEDIUM scope-expansion suggestion against an intentionally HIGH-only, single-line `pnpm.overrides` PR. The `flatted`/`ws`/`yaml` items are tracked individually as Open in `docs/scheduled-tasks/dependency-audit.md` and warrant per-override verification on the Tuesday cadence rather than being bundled into a focused production-bundle CVE fix. Replied inline with the scope rationale; no code change pushed.
- Reviews posted: 3
  - PR #1666 lodash-es override: Ready — focused security fix, lockfile change is a single resolution swap, all verification (audit, type-check, lint, format, tests 2809/2809, build) documented in the PR description. Companion audit-doc updates (axios → 1.16.0, tar override → >=7.5.11) are tracked Open items, not blockers.
  - PR #1665 personal-spotify gate: Ready — generalized `buildings?: string[]` field on `GlobalFeaturePermission` is small/additive (existing 15 features unaffected), `FEATURE_DEFAULTS` table centralizes missing-doc default behavior with `personal-spotify` matching the `canSeeShareTracking` precedent (default-off until explicit admin enable). Four new test files (477+ lines) cover the gate matrix, orphan-chip flow, transparent fallback. CI green across all 7 checks. Flagged `context/AuthContext.tsx`'s `canAccessFeature` as the highest-leverage change (called on every gate check) but coverage is good.
  - PR #1366 line-endings plan: Ready with minor notes — no new edits this sweep; all reviewer threads resolved across the prior four sweeps; only `.editorconfig` proposal continues deferred. Observation flagged: the PR is the canonical example of why execution is hard — 12+ revisions over 4 weeks because the renormalize-window precondition keeps reopening as new PRs land. Merging the docs is safe now; executing the plan still requires the quiet window.
- Notes:
  - Branch safety: zero pushes this run (no actionable code fixes needed). All three open PRs had either no actionable comments or pre-existing author replies. The `dev-paul` push permission was not exercised.
  - PR #1665 is the only ready-for-review (non-draft) PR open against `dev-paul` this sweep. CI is green. Author has already swept all six review threads in prior commits.
  - PR #1666 marks `scheduled-tasks` (the daily-audit / scripted-housekeeping branch) → `dev-paul`. Targeting `dev-paul` rather than `main` keeps the auto-deploy preview pipeline opt-in; expected behavior per the dev-\* deploy convention.
  - PR #1366's deferred `.editorconfig` proposal has now been carried forward across four sweeps. Worth a sentence in a future status nudge: either bundle it into PR 1 when the plan is finally executed, or close it explicitly. Not pushing without author input.

  - #1366 — docs: plan for repo-wide line-ending normalization (base `main`, head `docs/line-endings-normalization-plan`)
- Comments processed: 2 unresolved comment threads (both on PR #1657 from gemini-code-assist) — 1 fixed and 1 partially fixed/partially explained. PR #1655's three inline review threads were already resolved in earlier commits on the branch; PR #1655's three PR-level comments were already replied to in prior sweeps. PR #1366's remaining `.editorconfig` proposal continues to be deferred (third sweep — author decision pending).
- Fixes pushed: 1
  - PR #1657 / `scheduled-tasks` (`19ba1e8`): two-part fix for gemini-code-assist comments on the new `admin_audit_log` rule. (a) `firestore.rules` — changed `allow read, write` to `allow read, create` so audit entries are append-only (admins cannot edit/delete their own trail); expanded the inline comment to document why `create` (not `write`) is intentional so a future audit can't loosen it. (b) Kept `serverTimestamp()` at the call site — the reviewer's suggestion to switch to `Date.now()` + `is int` validation would WEAKEN security for an audit log (a client-supplied epoch is forgeable, server-set timestamps are not), so the consistency argument applies to data the client should own, not tamper-evident records. Added a rule comment documenting this choice. (c) `docs/scheduled-tasks/firestore-rules.md` — corrected line-range reference (`572-582` after the expanded comment grew the block, was `574-578`) and rewrote the 2026-05-18 audit-note bottom matter from "`admin_audit_log` HIGH open item remains unfixed" to "`admin_audit_log` HIGH item resolved in this PR — match block at lines 572-582 with append-only (`create` not `write`) permission." Verified: prettier ✓, lint ✓, type-check ✓ (test:rules requires firebase emulator not available in this env).
- Reviews posted: 3
  - PR #1657 admin_audit_log rule: Ready with minor notes — solid fix; follow-up suggestion to add `tests/rules/admin_audit_log.test.ts` locking in the immutability invariant (~30 lines, non-blocking), and to route the audit-write `catch` through the existing `logError()` utility so the next silent-deny class of bug surfaces faster. Reminder about post-merge `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules`.
  - PR #1655 Collections + Results Protection: Ready with notes — 146 files / ~17K+ additions, all 14 CI checks green, three prior inline review threads (DashboardContext dot-notation, SoundWidget unreachable resume, useResultsTabWarnings race) already validated and fixed earlier on the branch. Substantial new test coverage shipped (rebutting the prior "12 empty test files" claim — verified again, files have real content). Two human-attention items flagged: (1) PR title is better than the original `"Implement custom list toggling and drag-select enhancements"` but worth a final pass for git-log searchability, and (2) `context/DashboardContext.tsx` (+708/-35) + `types.ts` (+293/-1) + LRU mounting cache lifecycle warrant a manual walkthrough — the dot-notation `setDoc({merge:true})` bug fixed earlier in the same PR is the exact class of subtle Firestore-pipeline regression CLAUDE.md flags this file as prone to.
  - PR #1366 line-endings plan: Ready — no new edits this sweep, all reviewer items already addressed across the previous three sweeps. The single deferred item (`.editorconfig` proposal) carried forward; also flagged that the plan now self-handles the "PR 2 may be a no-op if blobs are already LF" case (`git status` probe between `git add --renormalize .` and `git commit`), so the author can probe locally before scheduling the dedicated window and possibly collapse the rollout to PR 1 + cleanup.
- Notes:
  - Branch safety: All fixes pushed only to `scheduled-tasks` (fair game per CRITICAL BRANCH SAFETY RULE). No push to `main`. `dev-paul` not pushed to this run — PR #1655's comments were already addressed by the author in earlier commits and no new fixes were needed, so the dev-paul push-permission did not need to be exercised.
  - Two of the three PRs (#1655 and #1366) had every actionable reviewer comment addressed before this sweep — these reviews are purely fresh-eyes reads. Only PR #1657 needed new code pushed.
  - Gemini-code-assist's `serverTimestamp() → Date.now()` suggestion on PR #1657 was a generic project-convention rule applied incorrectly to a tamper-evidence context. The reply on the inline comment explains the security rationale for keeping `serverTimestamp()` so the same suggestion isn't re-applied in future passes.

- Comments processed: 8 unresolved comment threads/issue-comments across the 3 PRs — 7 fixed and pushed, 1 deferred for author decision (PR #1366 `.editorconfig` scope expansion).
- Fixes pushed: 3
  - PR #1633 / `claude/widget-registry-settings-docs` (`fd47ee2b`): correct stickers flip-panel JSDoc + audit-log entry — the prior wording claimed `StickerBookWidget` hides the flip button, but `DraggableWindow.tsx:2688-2710` unconditionally renders the gear icon and `StickerBookWidget` has no flip-suppressing logic. Flipping a stickers widget shows the standard "Standard settings available." fallback on the Settings tab; appearance lives on the Style tab via `StickerBookAppearanceSettings`. Verified: tsc --noEmit ✓, eslint --max-warnings 0 ✓, prettier --check ✓.
  - PR #1632 / `scheduled-tasks`: same stickers JSDoc + audit-log correction applied (the PR carries a verbatim copy of PR #1633's WidgetRegistry.ts block and the same Completed entry). Pushed alongside the pr-review-log update for this run.
  - PR #1366 / `docs/line-endings-normalization-plan` (`a9eaa492`): five doc edits — Step 2 now creates a branch (`chore/normalize-line-endings`) before renormalize commands, adds `git status` sanity check between `--renormalize` and `commit` (so an empty-staging case isn't silently treated as a failure), and includes the `gh pr create` invocation with the title pinned to the Step 4 grep pattern; Step 5 working-tree refresh lifted out of the conflict-resolution block into an unconditional `git rm --cached -r . && git reset --hard` after the rebase loop (a conflict-free rebase never pauses for `--continue` so the prior phrasing left the operator without a refresh signal); Rollback section uses the same subject-grep + hard-fail + verification echo pattern as Step 4 instead of a `<renormalize-commit-hash>` placeholder, and adds a follow-up block to register the revert commit's hash in `.git-blame-ignore-revs` (the revert produces matching blame pollution on the same ~932 files). Verified: prettier --check ✓.
- Reviews posted: 3
  - PR #1633 widget-registry docs: Ready — JSDoc + audit-log both corrected during this pass; CI mostly green with Code Quality job still running; cross-PR consistency note flagged the verbatim duplicate in PR #1632 (which was fixed in parallel).
  - PR #1632 Friday audit: Ready — three daily audits performed, one new LOW item (MiniApp portaled active-app toolbar) detected with sound fix options. Cross-PR overlap with #1633 called out and resolved.
  - PR #1366 line-endings plan: Ready — five operator-failure-mode fixes applied this pass; `.editorconfig` proposal left for author decision.
- Notes:
  - Both gemini-code-assist threads on PR #1633 were inline review comments tied to the WidgetRegistry.ts JSDoc and the audit-log entry. Verified directly against `DraggableWindow.tsx` (gear icon unconditionally rendered) and `WidgetRenderer.tsx:169-173` (the "Standard settings available." fallback) — the JSDoc claim that StickerBookWidget hides the flip button was factually wrong. The audit-log entry was authored in the same PR (not a historical log), so correcting it from inception keeps the resolution accurate.
  - Coordination call-outs raised in reviews:
    - PR #1633 + #1632 — same JSDoc block duplicated across both PRs; whichever merges first wins, conflict resolution should preserve the corrected wording.
    - PR #1366 — `.editorconfig` would prevent the "Delete ␍" friction from returning on newly-created Windows files but is out of scope for this plan; author should decide whether to bundle into PR 1 or open a separate `feat: add .editorconfig` PR.

  - PR #1622 prepared diffs (verified locally — type-check ✓, lint ✓, 2458/2458 unit tests pass):
    - `firestore.rules:811`: replace `matches(uid + '_.*')` with `startsWith(uid + '_')` for shared_activity_walls sessionId-ownership check

  - PR #1622 quiz annotations: Needs changes — 3 of the 5 open reviewer threads have prepared fixes; the `firestore.rules:838` schema-lock concern was deferred as needing a deliberate mutable-field allow-list decision rather than an automated patch; declined the `htmlToPlainText` overload as a perf-refactor not a bug
  - PR #1621 substitute teacher portal: Ready with minor notes — every actionable reviewer thread closed by c733f59/613ccb2 in author's prior round (including the composite `(intendedMode, expiresAt)` index for `expireSubShares`); follow-ups for Phase 6 real widget renderer, i18n backfill, and emulator-based rules/function tests are explicitly called out by author
  - PR #1366 line-endings plan: Ready (eighth review on this PR with no content change since `da8f0946`); flagged that PR is ~3 weeks old and the "quiet window" precondition may need an updated execution date
- Notes:
  - Branch-safety: PR #1622's head is `dev-paul`. Per the CRITICAL rule, push to `dev-paul` is permitted "when there are PR comments on a PR merging dev-paul into main" — but the local proxy rejected the push with HTTP 403, indicating infrastructure-level branch protection takes precedence over the conditional permission. The prepared commit was reset and the diffs surfaced as inline suggestions so the maintainer can apply manually.
  - Coordination call-outs raised in reviews:
    - PR #1623 — i18n strings in `RandomGroups.tsx` / `StudentChip.tsx` / `UnassignedTray.tsx` / `ShuffleList.tsx` need a module-wide sweep PR (not a one-off fix)
    - PR #1622 — `shared_activity_walls` update rule should adopt a `keys().hasOnly([...])` schema-lock paired with rules tests for the disallowed-field-injection paths
    - PR #1366 — eight reviews and three weeks in; consider whether the renormalization can actually land in a quiet window given the current open-PR landscape

  - PR #1606 was already fast-following the HIGH item that #1605's Wednesday audit itself flagged (`DashboardContext.tsx` +937 lines/week). Cross-PR coherence: the audit identified the seam, the extraction PR landed the fix, both reviewed in the same nightly run.
  - PR #1600 and PR #1366 review threads all had prior author replies acknowledging fixes — skipped duplicate "already addressed" replies to avoid noise.
  - One cross-PR finding: PR #1605's `stations` admin-config gap (no `StationsConfigurationPanel`, no `FeatureConfigurationPanel` entry, no `getAdminBuildingConfig` case) is the same gap the `admin-widget-config` skill exists to prevent. Now in `utils/adminBuildingConfig.ts` after PR #1606 — surfacing here so the next stations-related merge picks it up.

  - Branch safety: today's run pushed only to `docs/line-endings-normalization-plan` (matches neither `main` nor `dev-*`). No writes to `main` or `dev-paul`.
  - 13 of the 16 unanswered review-comment threads on these PRs were already addressed in current code by the author across earlier commits — the threads remained "open" on GitHub because Copilot/Gemini comments are not auto-resolved when the underlying code changes. Posted "already addressed" replies citing the current line numbers and rationale.

## 2026-04-14

- PRs reviewed:
  - #1285 — large in-flight refactor (ref-in-render pattern discussion)
  - #1287 — focused refactor (memoization key suggestion)
  - #1288 — author actively iterating (google-labs-jules)
  - #1291 — dev-paul branch (read-only, comment-only scope)
  - #1292 — fetchWeatherProxy host-whitelist hardening
  - #1293 — quiz session live-leaderboard (BLOCKING: missing `broadcastLiveLeaderboard`)
  - #1294 — widget transparency centralization (bgHex threading)

- Comments processed: 20 total — 1 fixed, 19 explained
- Fixes pushed:
  - PR #1300 → `dependabot/...` branch cleanup: deleted 6 temporary `validate_status*.txt` artifacts via individual commits (`fix(pr-1300): remove temporary validate_status_N.txt artifact`)
- Reviews posted: 13
- Notes:
  - PR #1293 flagged as BLOCKING — `broadcastLiveLeaderboard` referenced in diff but not implemented in `hooks/useQuizSession.ts` on the head branch; consumers would crash at runtime.
  - PRs #1295 and #1296 are near-duplicates — recommended closing one.
  - PR #1291 is on `dev-paul` (dev-\* branch); per branch-safety policy, comments posted but no pushes.
  - PR #1294 touches `DraggableWindow` and `GlassCard` — visual QA pass recommended across representative widget set before merge.
  - Node modules were not installed locally; no `pnpm validate` runs possible. All fixes were low-risk file deletions or review comments that did not require local verification.

- Reviews posted: 2
  - PR #1318: Ready with minor notes — clean code following existing patterns, fills genuine gap (dead admin UI for 6 widgets). One open style comment is non-blocking.
  - PR #1311: Needs changes — large PR (51 files, +4766/-1588) with 3 items to address before merge: (1) verify QuizSession.id semantics change doesn't break consumers, (2) fix DiceWidget Roll button scaling regression, (3) confirm composite Firestore index for allocateJoinCode. Also noted ~1,500 lines of new Quiz Assignment code with no test coverage.
- Notes:
  - PR #1318 head SHA `53d22f4c` — mergeable state clean
  - PR #1311 head SHA `8ead5797` — mergeable state clean; Firestore rules changes are well-secured with proper auth checks and ownership enforcement
  - PR #1311 has HIGH regression risk around QuizSession.id changing from teacher UID to session UUID

  - PR #1328: 7 inline threads, all marked `is_outdated: true`. 6 reference files not in this PR's 3-file diff (pre-existing dev-paul comments carried over); the 1 relevant SeatingChart i18n thread was already addressed by the PR moving strings to `locales/en.json`. Reply posted on the relevant thread.
  - PR #1326: 13 threads total — 10 previously replied to by OPS-PIvers (8 fixed, 2 explicitly declined with rationale). 3 threads remain unaddressed at HEAD; per branch-safety policy no pushes made, findings rolled into Phase 2 review.
- Fixes pushed: none
  - PR #1329: reviewer concerns already resolved by PR's own diff
  - PR #1328: all comments outdated; relevant one already addressed in-branch
  - PR #1326: on `dev-paul` (dev-\* branch) — pushes prohibited
- Reviews posted: 3
  - PR #1329: Ready — pure docs refresh correcting genuine drift (hook/API names, stale counts, duplicated blocks); bundled deletion of `src/TestCalendar.tsx` stub keeps the "no `src/`" claim accurate
  - PR #1328: Ready with minor notes — clean swap onto shared `ScaledEmptyState` primitive with 6 test cases and a regression guard for the legacy `text-sm`/`text-xs` pattern; noted pre-existing i18n gap that `de`/`es`/`fr` locales don't have the new keys (nor the sibling `emptyStateFreeform`/`emptyStateTemplate` keys)
  - PR #1326: Needs changes (minor) — 3 items flagged: (1) `AbsentStudentsModal.toggleStudent` still calls `setAbsentStudents` inside a `setLocalAbsentIds` updater (side effect in pure function), (2) `useRosters.setAbsentStudents` does `await updateDoc` with no try/catch after optimistic state update, (3) `RandomWidget` uses `widgets.random.markAbsentTitle` / `markAbsentAria` keys that aren't in `en.json` — inconsistent with sibling `widgets.random.absent.*` namespace
- Notes:
  - PR #1329 head SHA `3a52afaf` — small, low-risk docs-only change
  - PR #1328 head SHA `386fdc87` — DRAFT status; 3-file diff cleanly scoped to SeatingChart empty states
  - PR #1326 head SHA `c6498487` — large feature bundle (22 files, +1401/-268); RandomWidget refactor is +343/-217 and warrants a human eye at 30+ student rosters

  - PR #1353: Ready with minor notes — MathTools scaling fix follows `cqmin` guidance; draft PR also bundles `tests/hooks/useLiveSession.test.ts` (not mentioned in PR body); recommend description update before marking ready
  - PR #1335: Needs changes (non-code) — 130+ file PR whose title/description cover only ~20% of the actual scope; bundles organization hierarchy (Organizations/Buildings/Domains/Roles/Users/StudentPage/Invites), full Library shell, and Manager/Importer refactor of four widgets (Quiz/MiniApp/VideoActivity/GuidedLearning) alongside the advertised Randomizer/dock/editor polish. Recommended splitting or rewriting the description. All 13 CI checks green. Flagged: `quizImportAdapter.ts` missing test coverage (sibling adapters have tests); `firestore.rules` +314 lines needs human verification; sibling changes to `AuthContext`/`AuthContextValue` may affect `getAdminBuildingConfig` permission-filtering path

  - PR #1391: 5 inline threads (copilot) — all requesting a `get`/`list` split on the five session collections' read rules.

  - PR #1399: 12 inline threads total
    - 9 outdated threads (8 gemini + 1 copilot on `AuthContext.memberLastActiveSyncedKeyRef` + `@/` import) — all already applied in current branch HEAD `c393d6e0` (bucket-level `erroredBuckets`, per-(uid,orgId) throttle key, success-only `stampLastActive`, `@/utils/lastActiveThrottle` import); replied with concrete code references
    - 2 non-outdated copilot threads on `OrganizationPanel.ManualResetLinkModal` lines 885–886 — requested a `useEffect` conversion of the `lastUrl`/`copied` reset. Declined: this is the "adjusting state while rendering" pattern that CLAUDE.md explicitly endorses for resetting state on prop change; both branches are guarded and converge in one extra render pass. Replied with the CLAUDE.md citation and the rationale already inline in the source.
    - 1 non-outdated gemini thread on `UsersView.tsx` amber banner accessibility — deferred to a future design-system PR that unifies the partial-failure banner across MyAssignmentsPage / UsersView / GuidedLearningAIGenerator; replied with the deferral rationale and an immediate contrast note (amber-900 on amber-50 clears 4.5:1; amber-800/90 body text is borderline).

  - PR #1422: 2 inline threads (gemini) — both `is_outdated: true` and already replied to with "fixed in 163e577" (`useCallback` import + memoized `getManualResetUrl` for `ManualResetLinkModal`); 3 PR-level comments from OPS-PIvers flagging follow-up issues (AssignmentArchiveCard a11y, PlcInviteAcceptance stuck-state, hardcoded `CLAIM_URL_ORIGIN`) — surfaced into Phase 2 review
  - PR #1414: 3 inline threads (1 gemini + 2 copilot) — all replied to: 2 fixed in `07cfae3` (lifted `usePlcs`/`usePlcInvitations` to Sidebar parent), 1 fixed in `693ebf3` (added `enabled?: boolean` option to both hooks); 1 PR-level OPS-PIvers comment about #1422 cross-PR coordination already on file

- Fixes pushed: none
  - No unaddressed comments required a code fix on any PR. All actionable gemini/copilot suggestions are already implemented in each PR's current head. The three flagged PR-level items on #1422 (a11y, stuck-state, CLAIM_URL_ORIGIN) were rolled into the Phase 2 review as merge-blocking notes since they affect production correctness and touch a `dev-paul → main` integration.
- Reviews posted: 5
  - PR #1429: Ready — 16 well-structured Vitest tests (~547 LoC) closing the `useQuizSessionTeacher` coverage gap (`removeStudent`, reveal/hide, `endQuizSession`, `advanceQuestion` including review-phase gate, startedAt-once, advance-past-end with finalize). Auto-progress effect remains the next gap, documented in `test-coverage.md`.
  - PR #1428: Ready with minor notes — clean dialog safety + type-widening fix; suggested adding a Vitest covering the destructive-variant Enter-suppression + Cancel-autofocus contract so the UX guarantee is regression-protected.
  - PR #1422: Needs changes — 89-file integration of PLCs + NeedDoPutThen widget + quiz hardening + reset-link modal + user-activity throttle. CI green and test discipline strong on most surfaces. Three blockers before merge to main: (1) author-flagged AssignmentArchiveCard `OverflowMenu` missing `aria-label` / `aria-haspopup` / `aria-expanded` / Escape handler (WCAG AA), (2) author-flagged `PlcInviteAcceptance` stuck `wrong-account` state after sign-out → sign-in (`if (load.kind !== 'idle') return;` guard short-circuits before re-fetch), (3) no `tests/rules/plc.test.ts` despite +255-line firestore.rules change for new PLC collections. Also flagged: hardcoded `CLAIM_URL_ORIGIN` in `plcInviteEmails.ts` breaks dev-preview testing; `DashboardContext.tsx` -28 net-line change warrants careful review of `getAdminBuildingConfig`; multi-feature dev-branch PR shape is a process observation worth discussing.
  - PR #1414: Ready with minor notes — clean retirement of `VITE_ENABLE_PLCS` flag plus thoughtful listener consolidation (Sidebar owns single `usePlcs`/`usePlcInvitations` pair; `enabled: isOpen` pauses subscriptions when drawer closed; net 6 → 3 → 0 listener reduction). Two follow-ups: (1) coordinate workflow-level `# DEV-FLAG` cleanup with #1422's flag introduction, (2) add Vitest covering the `enabled: false` gate on both hooks.
  - PR #1366: Ready — fourth automated daily review on this branch with no content change since 2026-04-21; nothing material to add. All six prior threads still addressed. Plan execution still gated on "no open PRs" precondition (5 open today, so not yet eligible).

- Reviews posted: 3
  - PR #1437: Ready — surgical Tuesday run with double-bumped hono in both `devDependencies` and `pnpm.overrides` (necessary because the override pinned the dep graph at 4.11.4 even though semver allowed newer); closes the open HIGH hono CVE class; 7/7 CI green; recommends `@google/genai@^1.50.1` as the natural follow-up to clear the new HIGH protobufjs entry + the existing MCP SDK MEDIUM in one shot
  - PR #1414: Ready with minor notes — same assessment as 2026-04-27 since head sha `693ebf39` unchanged; flag-retirement + listener-consolidation (0 listeners closed, 3 open vs prior 6) all sound; cross-PR coordination with #1422's `VITE_ENABLE_PLCS: 'true'` workflow addition still outstanding; tests for `enabled: false` gate still missing

- Comments processed: 9 total — 4 fixed (PR #1366 doc improvements bundled into one commit), 5 explained
  - PR #1470: 1 outdated inline thread (gemini-code-assist on `ai-integration.md` wording for the `magic-layout` fix description) — reply-explained, no code change (wording suggestion, comment is outdated, the actual implementation when this finding is acted on will be a single-line `functions/src/index.ts` change)
  - PR #1469: 10 inline threads — most outdated and addressed in subsequent commits on the branch (role=menu instead of listbox, focus management on open/close, full keyboard handler, useCallback wrapping of click-outside handler, focus-visible rings on menu items, length-truncation cleanup of itemRefs); 2 still-open threads reply-explained pointing at the addressing lines; 1 (gemini high-priority on music FAB opposite-side placement) declined by author with prior rationale, no further action
  - PR #1468: 2 unresolved inline threads (copilot suggesting `useRef` over `useState` for `prevUid` / `prevSessionId`) — both reply-explained: the `useState`-based "adjusting state while rendering" pattern is React's documented approach (per `CLAUDE.md`) and the synchronous re-render is intentional to avoid one-frame stale-data flashes
  - PR #1366: 4 issue-level comments from prior review rounds (Step 3 grep case-sensitivity, Steps 3/4 ordering, Step 5 missing `git add` / `git rebase --continue`, Step 4 `--ignore-all-space` over-broad) — all 4 fixed in a single commit on the branch
- Fixes pushed:
  - PR #1366 → `docs/line-endings-normalization-plan` branch: commit `da8f094` `docs(pr-1366): apply 4 review fixes to line-endings normalization plan` — Steps 3/4 swapped (verification now precedes squash-hash PR step), `SQUASH_HASH` lookup uses `grep -i` plus an explicit empty-hash hard-fail guard, verify-diff drops `--ignore-all-space` in favor of `--ignore-cr-at-eol` alone, rebase-conflict remediation adds the previously-missing `git add <file>` and `git rebase --continue` calls; format:check clean
- Reviews posted: 4
  - PR #1470: Ready — clean extract-method refactor of duplicated four-layer config merge into `mergeWidgetConfig` helper in `utils/widgetConfigPersistence.ts`; both `addWidget` and `addWidgets` delegate to it; 3 new unit tests cover layer ordering, transient-key stripping, all-undefined inputs; touches `DashboardContext.tsx` (regression-risk file) but layer order is preserved byte-for-byte; manual smoke of add-widget + AI-paste flows still unchecked in PR test plan
  - PR #1469: Ready with minor notes — 209-line new `BoardNavFab.tsx` with strong accessibility (role=menu, aria-labelledby, full keyboard nav, focus management, focus-visible rings), help-FAB stacking refactored from nested ternary to named-variable IIFE, dead board-switcher state/refs/effects removed from `Sidebar.tsx`; missing test coverage for the new component flagged as non-blocking follow-up; deliberate "all FABs on one edge" design choice noted (author already declined the music-FAB-opposite-side alternative)
  - PR #1468: Ready — three pattern-compliance refactors per `CLAUDE.md`: `prevSessionId`/`prevUid` "adjusting state while rendering" replaces `useEffect`-only-resets-refs, `shouldSubscribe` boolean replaces `setTimeout(..., 0)` deferral, `DriveAuthError` marker class enables `instanceof`-first classification with message-matching fallback preserved; backwards-compatible; 1678 tests pass per PR description
  - PR #1366: Ready — doc-only, all 4 earlier issue-level comments now addressed in `da8f094`; plan in better shape than at any prior review (operator-friendly step ordering, hard-fail squash-hash capture, accurate verify-diff, complete rebase remediation); execution still gated on "no open PRs" precondition (4 open today, including this PR)

  - PR #1491: Ready with minor notes — Sunday audit run; the diff against `main` includes the duplicated code changes (`useClickOutside`, `useVideoActivitySession`, `firestore.rules`, four StudentApp `logError` migrations, `config/tools.ts` JSDoc, `LazyChunkErrorBoundary` subtitle) that already exist on `dev-paul` and will resolve to no-op once the branch rebases. PR description claim ("audit-only") will read as inaccurate against the visible diff until that rebase happens. Recommend either rebasing onto current `dev-paul` or updating the description.

All 14 CI checks pass. Strong test coverage added (12+ new test files). Two regression-risk items worth a manual smoke pass: (1) widget config merging integration via `mergeWidgetConfig` in `DashboardContext`, (2) `DraggableWindow` world-bound clamping math with grouped widgets at zoom edges. Test gaps: `BoardNavFab` (216 lines, no test), `useSyncedQuizGroups` (338-line hook, rule-only coverage). Pre-existing `Stations` admin-config alignment gap noted as natural follow-up.

  - PR #1521 DOMPurify: Ready with minor notes — flagged adding back the SVG regression test and a `data:text/html` URI test to lock in the new `ALLOWED_TAGS`/URI behavior
  - PR #1519 perf (concurrent getUsers): Ready with minor notes — optional concurrency-cap follow-up for very large orgs (Firebase Auth quota: 1000 ops/sec)
  - PR #1512 perf (parallel email lookup): Ready
  - PR #1508 slugify: Ready with minor notes — `slugOrFallback` now returns variable lengths (≤24); verify no caller asserts `length === 24`
  - PR #1517 vs #1513 PLC tests: flagged as overlapping; recommended merging #1513 (stronger `memberUids` source-of-truth fix + caller-email-alias suppression) and closing #1517
  - PR #1516 backgrounds: Ready
  - PR #1515 testClassAccess: Ready
  - PR #1507 audit: Ready — flagged the two new dependency-audit items (axios MEDIUM `>=1.15.1`, firebase-functions `>=7.2.5` to resolve the protobufjs HIGH path) for follow-up upgrade PRs before next Tuesday cycle
  - PR #1502, #1503, #1504, #1505, #1506, #1509, #1510, #1518, #1520: Ready (focused test additions)
  - PR #1511, #1514, #1522, #1523: all four delete the same commented-out `MIN_GESTURE_SWIPE_DISTANCE` constant; flagged duplicate; recommended merging one (#1511 preferred — non-draft, base `dev-paul`) and closing the other three
  - PR #1366: Ready — eighth review with no content change since `da8f0946` (2026-05-01); all 6 prior threads addressed
- Notes:
  - Every open PR's unresolved review threads were already addressed by author "Fixed in [commit]" replies in prior runs (many marked `is_outdated:true` on GitHub but not `is_resolved:true`). No code/doc fixes pushed this run.
  - Coordination call-outs raised in reviews:
    - #1511 / #1514 / #1522 / #1523 — duplicate DraggableWindow cleanup PRs; merge one, close three
    - #1513 / #1517 — overlapping PLC tests; recommend #1513
    - #1504 / #1516 — overlapping `isCustomBackground` test additions on `dev-paul`; coordinate to avoid test-file conflicts
  - Branch-safety: PR #1507 head `scheduled-tasks` is the current branch (review-only). All other open PRs have non-`main` / non-`dev-*` head branches; no pushes were required this run.

  - #1677 — refactor(admin): remove dead magic/record/remote config panels (head `scheduled-tasks`, base `dev-paul`)
  - #1676 — PLC collaborative space redesign (head `dev-paul-plc-redesign`, base `dev-paul`)
  - #1366 — docs: line-endings normalization plan (head `docs/line-endings-normalization-plan`, base `main`)
- Comments processed: 0 actionable
  - #1677: no review comments.
  - #1676: all 4 inline review threads already `is_resolved:true` (gemini security comment on `plc_resources` rules + 3 obsolete normalization suggestions, all addressed at HEAD).
  - #1366: 6 threads `is_resolved:false` but `is_outdated:true`, each already carrying an author "Addressed" reply from a prior cycle. No new fix or reply needed (re-replying would be noise).
- Fixes pushed: 0
- Reviews posted: 3
  - PR #1677: Ready — clean dead-code removal; reasoning sound (mathTools/recessGear correctly left as global-config pattern, magic/record/remote keys confirmed unreferenced). Flagged one manual check: verify nothing else imports the deleted `SchemaDrivenConfigurationPanel`; `RemoteGlobalConfig` left as documented unused export.
  - PR #1676: Ready with minor notes — large (~73 files) but coherent old-bento→rail-nav swap with excellent test coverage incl. firestore rules tests. Firestore rules (`plcs/docs`, `plc_resources`) are schema-locked with `keys().hasOnly`, enum + type validation, and admin/member auth gates; prior security comment resolved. Notes: confirm rules tests run green in CI (need Java 21, not run locally), and this is Wave 1 of a multi-wave plan.
  - PR #1366: Ready — doc-only; all prior reviewer feedback addressed, open threads outdated. Execution must wait for a no-open-PR window.
- Notes:
  - Branch-safety: #1676 head `dev-paul-plc-redesign` matches `dev-*` → treated read-only (review comment only, no push). #1677 head `scheduled-tasks` and #1366 head `docs/*` are pushable, but Phase 1 produced no fixes, so no pushes to any PR branch this run.
  - This run's log + summary committed on branch `claude/clever-johnson-GghmZ` (the harness-designated development branch) rather than pushed directly to `scheduled-tasks`, since `scheduled-tasks` is the head of open PR #1677 and pushing to it would alter that PR without authorization.

  - #1366 — docs: line-endings normalization plan (head `docs/line-endings-normalization-plan`, base `main`)
- Comments processed: 0 actionable
  - #1366: 6 inline review threads `is_resolved:false` but 5 `is_outdated:true` (1 not outdated); every thread already carries an author "Addressed/Fixed in [commit]" reply from prior cycles. 26 PR-level review comments, all from prior automated sweeps and all already addressed — most recent sweep `17dfae3` (2026-05-20) covered the latest 5 comments; nothing posted since. No new fix or reply needed (re-replying would be noise).

  - PR #1366: Ready — doc-only; read the full 336-line doc and verified all prior reviewer feedback is now reflected at HEAD: step references consistent (Step 1→"step 4 adds the hash"), logical step order (config→renormalize→verify→register→cleanup), `--ignore-cr-at-eol` (not over-broad `--ignore-all-space`), subject-grep+`grep -i`+hard-fail hash lookup, rebase remediation with `git add`/`--continue`/unconditional working-tree refresh/`--force-with-lease`, `--ours`/`--theirs` rebase-vs-merge note, rollback via PR with `--no-edit` (main protected), and `blame.ignoreRevsFile` local config. Execution must wait for a no-open-PR window.
- Notes:
  - Branch-safety: only #1366 is open this run (PR #1677 from the 2026-05-21 entry is no longer open, so `scheduled-tasks` is no longer a PR head). #1366 head `docs/*` is pushable but Phase 1 produced no fixes — no pushes to any PR branch.
  - Log committed and pushed to `scheduled-tasks` directly this run, since it is no longer the head of any open PR.

  - #1916 — audit(tuesday) + fix(deps): close CRITICAL vitest CVE (head `scheduled-tasks`, base `dev-paul`)
- Comments processed: 5 total — 3 fixed, 2 explained
  - #1911: 3 unresolved gemini-code-assist French word-choice threads (Randomiseur vs Aléatoire, le Randomiseur vs l'aléatoire, « Suivant » vs « Prochain ») → all 3 FIXED in a pushed commit; consistent with existing `Randomiseur` term at fr.json:669.
  - #1912: 1 unresolved gemini thread requesting classIds/rosterIds sanitization → EXPLAINED (no fix): a later commit on the branch already destructures them out of `restData` and filters to non-empty strings; the spread is `...restData`, never a blind `...data`.
  - #1913: 1 thread (e.target null-guard) already `is_resolved:true` + `is_outdated:true` (fix already incorporated) → skipped silently.
  - #1909, #1910, #1914, #1915, #1916: no review comments.
- Fixes pushed: 1
  - #1911 / `nightly/admin-config-2026-06-09` — fr.json timeTool tips reworded to "Randomiseur"/"Suivant" for consistency; JSON valid, prettier clean, i18n test 8/8 passing.
- Reviews posted: 8 (one structured review per PR)
  - #1909: Ready — pure `@/` alias substitution, behavior-preserving.
  - #1910: Ready — doc-only unifier run 11 log.
  - #1911: Ready — locale parity fix + parity-enforcing regression test; gemini nits addressed.
  - #1912: Ready — destructure + `...restData` extraction mirrors normalizeVideoActivitySession (#1902); good test coverage.
  - #1913: Ready — SELECT guard + null-safety; minor non-blocking nit (double `<Dock />` render in the new test).
  - #1914: Ready — extracted advanceNextUpQueue (no in-place mutation) + render-body queueRef; minor nit (duplicate nextIdx computation).
  - #1915: Ready — doc-only debugger run 13 log; cross-refs consistent with #1911–#1914.
  - #1916: Ready with minor notes — CRITICAL vitest CVE bump; CI on Node 24 (frozen lockfile) is the authoritative gate (couldn't run install/suite locally — Node 22 here); `ws` MEDIUM remains a tracked follow-up.
- Notes:
  - Branch-safety: all 8 head branches are non-`main` / non-`dev-*` → pushable. Only #1911 required a fix push.
  - #1916 head is `scheduled-tasks` (this log's branch). The deps bump + audit journals it carries are scheduled-task artifacts in the same family as this log, so appending today's entry here is in-scope; pushed to `scheduled-tasks` per the POST-TASK workflow.
