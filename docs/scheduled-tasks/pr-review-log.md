# PR Review Log

_Automated nightly review by claude-opus-4-6_

---

## 2026-07-22

- PRs reviewed: 7 (all open PRs, all targeting `dev-paul`, all draft, all authored by the automated nightly system)
  - #2260 — docs(routines): log nightly unifier run 40 (head `nightly/unifier-log-2026-07-22`)
  - #2259 — refactor(syntax-framer): unify "Mode" settings label to group-heading pattern (head `nightly/unify-settings-labels-2026-07-22`)
  - #2258 — pr-review: nightly PR review log 2026-07-21 (head `claude/compassionate-shannon-rir4oc`)
  - #2257 — fix(deps): SECURITY force `ws@8` to `>=8.20.1` (head `deps/ws-uninitialized-memory`)
  - #2256 — audit(wednesday): daily/weekly scheduled-audit journals + 5 new test files (head `scheduled-tasks`)
  - #2255 — docs(routines): log nightly unifier run 39 (head `nightly/unifier-log-2026-07-21`)
  - #2254 — refactor(reveal-grid): unify "Reveal Mode" settings label to group-heading pattern (head `nightly/unify-settings-labels-2026-07-21`)
- Comments processed: 0 change-requests — 0 fixed, 0 required a fix. Zero unresolved inline review threads on any of the 7 PRs (`get_review_comments` empty on all). The only top-level comments are approving/LGTM `claude[bot]` reviews and informational follow-ups (#2256 carries a fresh 2026-07-22 `claude[bot]` LGTM plus an earlier docs review + a dependency-prioritisation note); none requests a change, so no reply and no code fix was needed.
- Fixes pushed: 0 — no comment required a code change and no diff-level defect was found in any PR.
- Reviews posted: 3 (on the three PRs that had no prior review — #2258, #2259, #2260).
  - #2259 — Ready. Mechanical a11y retrofit of the `SyntaxFramer/Settings.tsx` "Mode" label to the group-heading `SettingsLabel` shape (`as="span"` + `id` + `role="group"`/`aria-labelledby`). Verified against `components/common/SettingsLabel.tsx` source directly: both `as` branches compute an identical `combinedClasses` and this call site has no `htmlFor`, so the rendered output is byte-identical — zero visual delta. `id` correctly scoped to `${widget.id}` (per-instance render via `DraggableWindow`).
  - #2260 — Ready. Docs-only unifier run-40 memory log; the code it describes ships in #2259. Stacked on the still-open #2255 branch, so its diff carries run-39 content until #2255 merges (noted in the PR).
  - #2258 — Ready. Docs-only 2026-07-21 review-log entry, consistent with the file's format.
  - #2254, #2255, #2256, #2257 were NOT re-reviewed — each already carries a fresh, thorough approving/LGTM `claude[bot]` review (#2256's dated today, 2026-07-22); a duplicate structured review would be pure noise. All four diffs were still independently inspected and confirmed clean: #2259/#2254 are the same mechanical group-heading a11y pattern; #2257 is a correctly-scoped `ws@8` `pnpm.overrides` entry; #2256 is docs-only audit journals plus 5 new well-structured test files.
- Notes:
  - Branch safety: no push to `main` or any `dev-*` head. No code fixes were pushed to any PR branch this run (nothing was actionable). This review-log commit is on the designated `claude/compassionate-shannon-vh8le5` branch — rebuilt from the latest `origin/dev-paul` (it previously carried only already-merged `dev-paul`→`main` merge commits, no unique work) so the log PR is a clean single-file diff. Kept off `scheduled-tasks` deliberately: that branch is the head of the unrelated open audit PR #2256 (a different routine's session), matching the run-18/run-19/run-21 precedent of not polluting an in-flight PR.
  - Env runs Node 22 (repo pins 24, "Unsupported engine" warning); no local fix-verification was needed since nothing was pushed to a PR branch. CI on Node 24 remains the authoritative gate.

## 2026-07-20

- PRs reviewed: 11 (all open PRs)
  - #2253 — fix(activity-wall): photo-grid rowHeight resize-continuous via cqmin (head `scheduled-tasks`, base `dev-paul`, draft)
  - #2252 — docs(routines): log nightly debugger run 31 (head `nightly/debugger-log-2026-07-20`)
  - #2251 — fix(functions): SECURITY — relock `activity_wall_sessions` after gallery share expires/revokes (head `nightly/build-tooling-2026-07-20`)
  - #2250 — fix(config): replace non-existent `Football` lucide icon in instructional icon picker (head `nightly/admin-config-2026-07-20`)
  - #2249 — fix(rosters): `assignPins` no longer collides with manually-set PINs (head `nightly/state-data-2026-07-20`)
  - #2248 — fix(DraggableWindow): cancel touch long-press timers on unmount (head `nightly/dashboard-layout-2026-07-20`)
  - #2247 — fix(LunchCount): key assignments by roster student id, not display name (head `nightly/widgets-2026-07-20`)
  - #2246 — docs(routines): log nightly unifier run 38 (head `nightly/unifier-log-2026-07-20`)
  - #2245 — fix(RevealGrid): unify "Game Mode" settings label to `SettingsLabel as="span"` (head `nightly/unify-settings-labels-2026-07-20`)
  - #2244 — Enhance GraphicOrganizer config and fix various issues (head `dev-paul`, base `main` — release PR)
- Comments processed: 7 total inline threads — 0 newly fixed, 7 explained & resolved. (Two further PRs, #2253 and #2244, had only already-resolved threads — no action needed.)
  - #2251 (3 threads): redundant-write guard (line 137) and its paired test assertion — both already addressed on-branch in `2395fe1`; replied and resolved. Serialized-loop perf note (line 111) — flagged non-blocking at current scale by the reviewer; replied acknowledging, resolved, no change.
  - #2250 (2 threads, both outdated): Ghost/Goal alphabetical ordering already fixed in `be9ce16`; single-line test comment already trimmed in `010ab49`. Replied and resolved both.
  - #2247 (2 threads): stuck legacy-name unassign (line 359) already fixed in `a18490a`; orphaned legacy-key on reassignment (line 390) already fixed in `a6a4e96`. Replied and resolved both.
- Fixes pushed: 0 — every actionable review comment across all open PRs had already been resolved by later commits on its own branch (the nightly orchestrator applied the fixes but never closed the threads). No code fix was required this run.
- Reviews posted: 11 (a structured review on every open PR)
  - #2249: Ready — correct `assignPins` extraction with collision-avoidance Set + advancing counter; behavior preserved for all-blank rosters; 5 regression tests.
  - #2248: Ready — write-once `isUnmountedRef` unmount guard on both long-press timers; targeted regression test; legit external-sync `useEffect`.
  - #2245: Ready — pure a11y `SettingsLabel as="span"` + `role="group"` retrofit, zero visual delta.
  - #2247: Ready — id-keyed assignments with legacy-name fallback + eviction; both inline threads resolved.
  - #2250: Ready — `Football`→`Goal` swap + all-entries-resolve test; both nits resolved.
  - #2251: Ready — new hourly relock sweep closes a real submissions/photo data-exposure hole; strong test coverage; redundant-write guard resolved.
  - #2253: Ready — JS-px `gridAutoRows` → `minmax(clamp(...cqmin...), 1fr)`, resize-continuous and container-fitting; reviewer note adopted in `c7332e95`.
  - #2252, #2246: Ready — documentation-only nightly run logs, no source changes.
  - #2244: Ready with human sign-off — `dev-paul`→`main` release PR; the security-sensitive `shared_activity_walls` read-gating gaps were closed in `5fb0649` with rules + component tests; warrants a final human review of the aggregate diff since it targets `main`.
- Notes:
  - Branch safety: no code fixes were pushed to any PR branch this run. `main` untouched; no push to `dev-paul` (#2244) was needed. This log is committed to `scheduled-tasks` per the routine convention.
  - Every open PR was authored by the automated nightly system and its actionable comments were self-resolved on-branch, so this run's work was thread cleanup (reply + resolve) plus independent review sign-off, not code repair.
  - Env runs Node 22 (repo wants 24); no local fix-verification was needed since nothing was pushed to a PR branch. CI on Node 24 remains the authoritative gate.

## 2026-07-19

- PRs reviewed: 7 (all open PRs, all targeting `dev-paul`)
  - #2242 — fix(rules): gate `shared_activity_walls` read on revoked/expiresAt (head `nightly/build-tooling-2026-07-19`)
  - #2241 — fix(i18n): ES plcRoute/plcDirectory + FR sidebar.nav.plcs PLC-acronym drift (head `nightly/admin-config-2026-07-19`)
  - #2240 — fix(RemoteControlMenu): clear stale copy-link timer on rapid re-click (head `nightly/dashboard-layout-2026-07-19`)
  - #2239 — fix(TimeTool): re-enable "+" once a ceiling-started run decays below it (head `nightly/widgets-2026-07-19`)
  - #2238 — action(admin-config): GraphicOrganizer building-default appearance config (head `scheduled-tasks`)
  - #2237 — docs(unifier): log nightly run 37 (head `nightly/unifier-log-2026-07-19`)
  - #2236 — a11y: convert RandomSettings "Operation Mode" label to group heading (head `nightly/unify-settings-labels-2026-07-19`)
- Comments processed: 2 total — 0 newly fixed, 2 explained/resolved.
  - #2240 inline nit (claude[bot]): reorder `clearTimeout` before `setCopied(true)` in `handleCopyLink`. Already addressed on-branch by commit `789c102`; replied and resolved the thread. No code change needed.
  - #2238 inline nit (claude[bot], outdated): export a runtime `GRAPHIC_ORGANIZER_LAYOUT_TYPES` array from `types.ts` to remove manual-copy drift. Already addressed on-branch by commit `c906e67` (derives the type from the shared const and validates against it); replied and resolved the thread. No code change needed.
- Fixes pushed: 0 (both actionable comments were already resolved by later commits on their branches).
- Reviews posted: 5 (structured reviews on the PRs without a prior review)
  - #2242: Ready with minor notes — correct server-side revoke/expiry gating mirroring `/shared_boards`; flagged the `expiresAt`-stored-as-millis assumption to confirm on the write path.
  - #2241: Ready — data-only locale fix with correctly-scoped regression tests.
  - #2239: Ready — stale `config.elapsedTime` term removed; write-storm still guarded by `adjustTime`'s no-op check; test updated.
  - #2237: Ready — documentation-only run log.
  - #2236: Ready — mechanical a11y group-heading retrofit, zero visual delta.
  - #2240, #2238: skipped a duplicate review — both already carry a `claude[bot]` structured review; only the comment follow-ups above were handled.
- Notes:
  - Branch safety: all 7 heads are non-`main`/non-`dev-*` (nightly/\* and `scheduled-tasks`) → pushable, but no fixes were required this run.
  - Env runs Node 22 (repo wants 24); no local fix-verification was needed since nothing was pushed to a PR branch. CI on Node 24 remains the authoritative gate.

## 2026-07-14

- PRs reviewed: 1 (all open PRs)
  - #2204 — fix(deps): override ts-deepmerge to ^8.0.0 in functions (GHSA-87mf-gv2c-c62c) (head `deps/ts-deepmerge-8`, base `dev-paul`, draft)
- Comments processed: 0 actionable — 0 fixed, 0 explained.
  - #2204 has no inline review threads. Existing feedback is a Gemini `COMMENTED` review with no change requests (neutral LGTM + Gemini-Code-Assist sunset notice) and a `claude[bot]` issue comment that is an explicit LGTM. Neither requires a code fix; no per-comment replies posted (both are automated bot approvals — replying would be pure noise, per frugality).
- Fixes pushed: 0 (no comment required an automated code fix this run)
- Reviews posted: 1 (one structured review)
  - #2204: Ready — minimal two-file security override (`functions/package.json` + `functions/pnpm-lock.yaml`) resolving the `ts-deepmerge` prototype-override DoS. Independently verified the core claim: `grep` across the entire `functions/` tree for `ts-deepmerge`/`firebase-functions-test` returns zero source imports, so the known v8 default-export forward-compat hazard (fft's cloudevent `wrap()`) is dormant. Flagged that no CI checks have reported on the head commit yet (combined status `pending`, 0 checks) — confirm PR validation is green before merge.
- Notes:
  - Branch-safety: #2204 head is `deps/ts-deepmerge-8` (non-`main`/non-`dev-*`) → pushable; no fix was required this run. Base is `dev-paul`.
  - Env runs Node 22 (repo wants 24); no local fix verification was needed since no fix was pushed. CI on Node 24 remains the authoritative gate.

## 2026-07-01

- PRs reviewed: 7 (all open PRs)
  - #2124 — docs(unifier): run 23 sixth consecutive all-aligned (head `nightly/unifier-log-2026-07-01`, base `dev-paul`)
  - #2123 — fix(quiz): strict Matching compares unique prompts, not raw pair count (head `claude/serene-meitner-tofij0`, base `dev-paul`)
  - #2120 — fix(deps): bump dompurify to 3.4.11 (GHSA-cmwh-pvxp-8882) (head `deps/dompurify-3.4.11`, base `dev-paul`)
  - #2119 — audit(tuesday): scheduled audit journals 2026-06-30 + new useScreenRecord test (head `scheduled-tasks`, base `dev-paul`)
  - #2118 — docs(unifier): run 23 (2026-06-30) (head `nightly/unifier-log-2026-06-30`, base `dev-paul`)
  - #2101 — fix(dashboard): Escape-minimize + screen-record listener stabilisation (head `nightly/dashboard-2026-06-28`, base `dev-paul`)
  - #2098 — Audit updates, empty-state scaling, analytics labels (head `dev-paul`, base `main`) — dev-paul→main promotion (push to dev-paul only via the sanctioned review-comment-fix path)
- Comments processed: 2 unresolved threads actioned — 0 fixed, 2 explained. Every other PR's inline threads already carried author replies or were resolved-in-code.
  - #2119: 2 open `claude` threads on the new `tests/hooks/useScreenRecord.test.ts` → both EXPLAINED, no push. (1) Real hook bug — `useScreenRecord` unmount cleanup (`hooks/useScreenRecord.ts:94-101`) stops the tracks but never calls `recorder.stop()`, so `onstop`→`onSuccess` can fire post-unmount; not auto-fixed (functional hook change, out of scope for an audit-journal PR, and needs a mounted-ref guard rather than a one-line `stop()`). (2) Empty-recording 0-byte-blob behavior is an undefined contract → product decision, not a mechanical fix.
  - #2098 (5 threads), #2101 (~30 threads), #2123 (2 gemini "separate PR" threads) → all already had author replies / were resolved-in-code; no new action.
  - #2124, #2120, #2118: no unresolved review threads.
- Fixes pushed: 0 (no comment required an automated code fix this run)
- Reviews posted: 7 (one structured review per PR)
  - #2124: Ready with minor notes — doc-only run-23 log; flagged duplicate "run 23" title shared with #2118.
  - #2123: Ready — correct `seenLefts.size` grading fix + 3 regression tests; mind land-order vs #2098.
  - #2120: Ready — dompurify security bump + pnpm override; single resolved `3.4.11`.
  - #2119: Ready with minor notes — docs + solid new screen-record test; flagged the real hook-cleanup bug for a dedicated follow-up and the scope mix (327-line test in an audit-journal PR).
  - #2118: Ready with minor notes — doc-only; duplicate "run 23" title shared with #2124.
  - #2101: Ready with minor notes — two well-diagnosed bug fixes; residual acknowledged gaps (driveService ~hourly churn, a few unguarded window escape listeners).
  - #2098: Ready with minor notes — dev-paul→main promotion; confirm #2123 lands first, track the deferred read-only-Escape follow-up.
- Notes:
  - Branch-safety: #2098 head is `dev-paul` (promotion into `main`) — review-only except the sanctioned dev-paul push path for review-comment fixes; none were needed. All other heads are non-`main`/non-`dev-*` → pushable; no fixes were required this run.
  - Cross-PR flag: #2124 and #2118 are both titled "run 23" and open simultaneously against `dev-paul` with overlapping `unifier.md` edits — reconcile before merging both.
  - Env runs Node 22 (repo wants 24); no local fix verification was needed since no fix was pushed. CI on Node 24 remains the authoritative gate.

## 2026-06-28

- PRs reviewed: 9 (all open PRs)
  - #2106 — feat(admin-config): expand TimeTool building-config 3→11 fields (head `scheduled-tasks`, base `dev-paul`)
  - #2105 — chore(docs): nightly debugger run 22 (head `nightly/debugger-2026-06-28`, base `dev-paul`)
  - #2104 — fix(plcWeeklyDigest): removed member leaks via legacy memberEmails mirror (head `nightly/build-2026-06-28`, base `dev-paul`)
  - #2103 — fix(analytics): add missing labels for 7 programmatic widget types (head `nightly/admin-2026-06-28`, base `dev-paul`)
  - #2102 — fix(GraphicOrganizer): render-body ref assignment prevents stale onUpdate closure (head `nightly/widgets-2026-06-28`, base `dev-paul`)
  - #2101 — fix(dashboard): Escape-minimize + screen-record listener stabilisation (head `nightly/dashboard-2026-06-28`, base `dev-paul`)
  - #2100 — docs(unifier): run 22 — fifth consecutive all-aligned run (head `nightly/unifier-log-2026-06-28`, base `dev-paul`)
  - #2099 — Address PR #2098 review comments (head `claude/serene-meitner-ah9zj6`, base `dev-paul`)
  - #2098 — Audit updates, fix empty-state scaling, analytics labels (head `dev-paul`, base `main`) — READ-ONLY (`dev-*` head: review/comment only, no push)
- Comments processed: ~23 unresolved threads across 5 PRs — 0 fixed by this run, all explained/already-addressed. No fix push was needed: every actionable inline comment was already resolved in committed code by the author sessions (verified by reading the files at branch HEAD), or is a design-decision/architectural note being handled in active iteration.
  - #2106: all 7 review threads already `is_resolved`. Gemini duration-clamp (59999) + test applied (`7d80677`); shared `config/timeTool.ts` extracted (`5e3ce6f`); `SurfaceColorSettings` decline is correct (`themeColor` is a `WIDGET_PALETTE` hex, not `cardColor`). Nothing to do.
  - #2103: 7 unresolved threads — ALL already addressed in HEAD code: `PROGRAMMATIC_WIDGET_LABELS` is `Partial<Record<WidgetType,string>>`, dual `_exhaustiveCheck`/`_reverseExhaustiveCheck` compile guards present, comments reduced to one-liners, redundant `hasOwnProperty` test removed. Threads simply not marked resolved.
  - #2102: 1 unresolved gemini thread (timeoutRef mgmt) — already addressed: debounce callback nullifies `timeoutRef.current`, `handleBlur` only flushes when pending, unmount-cleanup effect present. `isConnected` guard intentionally omitted (redundant given the pending-timeout guard).
  - #2101: 13 threads (2 author-retracted re: `react-hooks/refs` being a real rule in v7.0.1). Core fixes correct. Three genuine live notes surfaced in the posted review rather than pushed (PR was under active iteration, last commit 06:02Z — avoided conflicting commits): (1) `Dock.test.tsx ~L549` may not actually guard the regression (module-level `useScreenRecord` mock ignores the `onError` arg); (2) `stopImmediatePropagation` blast radius across other unguarded window/document Escape handlers; (3) `driveService` hourly identity churn → once-per-hour listener re-register gap.
  - #2098: 3 threads (NonNullable answers typing, NumberLine `htmlFor`, AI-feature 3-location sync comment) — all addressed via #2099, which routes the fixes into this branch.
  - #2105: 1 unresolved gemini thread (lowercase repo path in doc URLs) — cosmetic + anchored hunk outdated; non-blocking, noted in review.
  - No redundant per-thread replies were posted: threads were already addressed in-code or already carried an author resolution reply — adding "already fixed" replies to ~23 threads would be pure noise (frugality).
- Fixes pushed: 0 (no genuine unaddressed actionable comment remained; #2101's live items were left for the actively-iterating author session and surfaced as review feedback).
- Reviews posted: 9 (one structured review per PR)
  - #2106: Ready — 3→11 field expansion with sound per-field validation; all threads resolved.
  - #2105: Ready — doc-only debugger run-22 log.
  - #2104: Ready — well-tested privacy fix (removed-member digest leak); `removedUids` second guard.
  - #2103: Ready — clean label-map extraction; all inline comments addressed in-code.
  - #2102: Ready — render-body ref sync per CLAUDE.md; timeoutRef concerns addressed.
  - #2101: Ready with minor notes — core fixes correct; flagged Dock test / blast-radius / driveService notes for human verification before merge.
  - #2100: Ready — doc-only unifier run-22 log.
  - #2099: Ready — applies the three #2098 review fixes; merge order (this → dev-paul → main) noted.
  - #2098: Ready with minor notes — verify #2099 is folded in and CI green before merging to `main`.
- Notes:
  - Branch-safety: no pushes to `main` or any `dev-*` branch. #2098 (head `dev-paul`) treated read-only — reviewed/commented only. The other 8 heads are pushable but required no fix push this run.
  - This log is committed to the designated working branch `claude/compassionate-shannon-4t37a1` rather than `scheduled-tasks`, because `scheduled-tasks` is the head of open PR #2106 — committing there would pollute that PR's diff. Consistent with prior runs (2026-06-27/06-24/06-21/06-19).

## 2026-06-27

- PRs reviewed: 6 (all open PRs; all base `dev-paul`, none `main`/`dev-*` → all pushable)
  - #2096 — scheduled-tasks 2026-06-27: audit + ActivityWall empty-state scaling fix (head `scheduled-tasks`, base `dev-paul`)
  - #2095 — chore(docs): nightly debugger run 21 (head `nightly/debugger-log-2026-06-27`, base `dev-paul`)
  - #2094 — fix(analytics): add missing AI feature labels for 6 Gemini features (head `nightly/admin-2026-06-27`, base `dev-paul`)
  - #2093 — fix(quiz): use first-occurrence answers in exportResultsToSheet stats block (head `nightly/state-2026-06-27`, base `dev-paul`)
  - #2092 — fix(NumberLine): Escape cancels min/max/step edits without saving (head `nightly/widgets-2026-06-27`, base `dev-paul`)
  - #2091 — docs(unifier): run 21 — fourth consecutive all-aligned run (head `nightly/unifier-log-2026-06-27`, base `dev-paul`)
- Comments processed: 10 unresolved threads across 3 PRs — 1 fixed, 9 explained/acknowledged (every other thread was already satisfied by a later commit on its branch and is marked `is_outdated`)
  - #2093: gemini `utils/quizDriveService.ts:731` (`r.answers ?? []` defensive guard) → FIXED. 2 claude threads on the test teardown (`vi.unstubAllGlobals`) → EXPLAINED no-op: the surviving test file `tests/utils/quizDriveService.test.ts` uses `vi.spyOn(global,'fetch')` + `afterEach(vi.restoreAllMocks)` (the reviewer's own suggested alternative); the colocated `vi.stubGlobal` file was replaced.
  - #2094: 2 gemini import-path threads (re-export / test import from `aiFeatureLabels.ts`) + 1 claude drop-PR-number-from-comment + 1 claude redundant-second-test → all already addressed in later commits (EXPLAINED): `AnalyticsManager.tsx` only imports (no re-export), test imports from `@/components/admin/Analytics/aiFeatureLabels`, the comment carries no PR number, and the second test is now a `toEqual` exhaustiveness check. 2 claude architectural threads (export `GEMINI_SPECIFIC_FEATURES` across the functions↔root boundary; acknowledge the inherent cross-package mirror gap) → EXPLAINED no-op (architectural / inherent constraint, not an unattended-fix candidate; flagged for human consideration of a shared constants module).
  - #2095: gemini `docs/routines/debugger.md` count (`has 10` → `has 11`) → EXPLAINED: already corrected on-branch; both the Run Log entry and backlog item now read `has 11` / `all 11 entries`.
- Fixes pushed: 1
  - #2093 / `nightly/state-2026-06-27` (`a295e3d`) — `fix(pr-2093): guard r.answers with ?? [] in exportResultsToSheet dedup loop`. Mirrors the defensive guard in `buildResultsSheetDataShared`. type-check ✓ lint ✓ tests ✓ (24/24).
- Reviews posted: 6 (one structured review per PR)
  - #2096: Ready — ActivityWall empty-state heading `fontSize: min(14px, 5.5cqmin)` + scaled `marginTop` (correct medium-text tier; preserves hierarchy vs subtitle); journal's ⚠️ false-premise correction on the appearance-panel MEDIUM is well-evidenced.
  - #2095: Ready — doc-only debugger run-21 log; count nit already resolved.
  - #2094: Ready with minor notes — clean label-map extraction; only the documented cross-package mirror gap remains as a non-blocking follow-up.
  - #2093: Ready — first-occurrence dedup matches grader semantics; `?? []` guard pushed; strong regression suite (24/24).
  - #2092: Ready — Escape-cancel `cancelledRef` pattern consistent with #1965/#1974/#1975/#2064; 10 tests; `aria-label`s added.
  - #2091: Ready — doc-only unifier run-21 log.
- Notes:
  - Branch-safety: all 6 head branches are non-`main`/non-`dev-*` → pushable; only #2093 required a fix push. No pushes to `main` or `dev-paul`.
  - This log is committed to the designated working branch `claude/compassionate-shannon-0f10tg` rather than `scheduled-tasks`, because `scheduled-tasks` is the head of open PR #2096 — committing there would pollute that PR's diff. Consistent with prior runs (2026-06-24/06-21/06-19).
  - Verification ran on Node 22 locally (project requires Node 24); `tsc --noEmit`, scoped `eslint --max-warnings 0`, and the affected vitest suite were green for the touched files. CI on Node 24 remains the authoritative gate.

- Comments processed: 13 unaddressed threads — 5 fixed, 8 explained/flagged. (Many other threads already carried author "Fixed in …" replies and were skipped.)
  - **Fixed (5):**
    - #2078 Widget.tsx:2040 — destructure targeting fields out of patch (type-narrows `settingsPatch`) instead of spread+`delete`.
    - #2080 useSubstituteShares.ts:285 — invert expiry guard so a missing `expiresAt` is treated as expired.
    - #2080 expireSubShares.ts:199 — re-throw after `Promise.allSettled` so sweep failures surface as a failed invocation.
    - #2081 AuthContext.tsx:2564 — clear `accessDeactivated` only after sign-in succeeds (popup-cancel no longer drops the DeactivatedScreen).
    - #2081 UsersView/primitives — bulk role picker `role="group"` + opt-in `aria-pressed` (without breaking shared `PopoverOption` menu usages).
  - **Explained, no change (3):**
    - #2078 Widget.tsx:2058 (dead guard) — coupling is intentional/documented; guard kept as defensive boundary.
    - #2079 LinksPanel.tsx:154 (useState→useMemo) — `useMemo(()=>Date.now())` fails the repo's `react-hooks/purity` lint rule; `useState` lazy init is the compliant pattern.
    - #2079 AnalyticsManager.tsx:1809 (tabBar focus) — promotion-to-component doesn't fix position-based reconciliation; needs a shared-parent restructure (architectural).
  - **Flagged for manual review (3):**
    - #2080 firestore.rules:1116 — `subEmails` not validated server-side (pre-existing on boards path; needs a CF domain-validation wrapper).
    - #2081 firestore.rules:462 — domain admin can still deactivate/downgrade an existing `super_admin` (security residual; needs policy decision + guard + CI-validated rules test).
    - #2081 UsersView.tsx:542 — role picker lists `super_admin` for `domain_admin`; client companion to the rules decision above.
  - **Outdated/already-fixed (2):**
    - #2083 unifier.md — `DEFAULT_GLOBAL_STYLE` reference already correct as committed (verified vs `types.ts:6579`).
    - #2084 code-structure.md — large-file count inconsistency already fixed on-branch in `472bbba`.
- Fixes pushed: 4 commits across 3 branches
  - #2078 `audit/quiz-rosterids` `7c16b45` — destructure targeting fields from patch.
  - #2080 `audit/subs-collections` `5604cdb` — treat missing `expiresAt` as expired.
  - #2080 `audit/subs-collections` `c55b1d8` — re-throw after `allSettled`.
  - #2081 `audit/rules-auth-hardening` `0300295` — deactivation flag on popup-cancel + bulk role picker a11y.
  - All verified locally before push: `pnpm type-check` ✓, scoped `eslint --max-warnings 0` ✓, prettier ✓, and the relevant vitest suites (`useSubstituteShares` 20/20, `AuthContext.deactivation` 3/3, `UsersView.bulkRoleBuilding` 3/3) ✓. Functions change passed `tsc --noEmit` + functions eslint.
- Reviews posted: 9 (one structured review per PR)
  - #2078 Ready with minor notes · #2079 Ready with minor notes · #2080 Ready with minor notes (deploy new index) · #2081 **Needs changes** (super-admin deactivate/downgrade protection + CI rules green) · #2082 Ready · #2077 Ready (docs) · #2083 Ready (docs) · #2084 Ready (docs) · #2076 Ready with notes (land #2082 into dev-paul first; confirm CI before dev-paul→main).
- Notes:
  - Branch-safety: #2076 head is `dev-paul` (dev-_) → READ-ONLY; reviewed/commented only, no push. All fixes went to non-`main`/non-`dev-_` feature branches.
  - Could not locally verify any `firestore.rules` change (no Firestore emulator in this env) and the file is at ~98.5% of the 256 KiB cap — so the two rules-level security items on #2081/#2080 were flagged for human + CI rather than auto-patched.

## 2026-06-25

  - #2072 — Audit updates and fixes for admin settings and widget configurations (head `dev-paul`, base `main`)
- Comments processed: 11 total — 0 fixed, 2 explained (replies), 9 skipped (already addressed by author in `6573248` / outdated / informational)
  - #2075: 1 gemini inline thread (`@/` alias in `ScaledEmptyState` import snippet) → EXPLAINED: already fixed in commit `9992a19`, thread now outdated. 2 claude review summaries → no action (approvals/notes).
  - #2074: gemini "unsupported file types" note → no action (informational, doc-only PR).
  - #2072: 7 inline threads already resolved by author in `6573248` (stale-closure ref restore, NOT_FOUND toast, 2× redundant `Promise.resolve`, 2× test-correctness gaps, O(N·M)→O(M) resend) → SKIPPED (functionally addressed). 1 open thread (`users.filter` vs `filtered.filter`, UsersView:382) → EXPLAINED (replied): UX judgment, not a bug — `users.filter` keeps bulk Resend consistent with bulk Deactivate/Delete which act on all `selected`; declined automated change.
- Fixes pushed: 0
  - Investigated 3 newer review-level items on #2072 and concluded none warranted an automated fix:
    1. **Deactivate ungated by `canManageUsers` (UsersView:422)** — FALSE POSITIVE. Deactivation is governed by `canEditStatus = inScope` (line 574), deliberately separate from `canManage`; `building_admin`s are intended to deactivate in-scope users and `selected` is already scope-restricted. Guarding it would remove a legitimate capability.
    2. **UTC-midnight due-date parse (QuizManager:2300)** — NOT A BUG. Current parse is symmetric with the `toISOString()` display (line 2292) and matches the documented date-only convention in `utils/localDate.ts` (`splitDueAtToInputs(hasTime=false)`). The suggested local-midnight change would break symmetry for UTC+ timezones; a correct change requires moving both parse and display to local components together.
    3. **`users` vs `filtered` (UsersView:382)** — UX decision, declined (see replied thread above).
- Reviews posted: 3 (one structured review per PR)
  - #2075: Ready — doc journal updates + correct additive `First5Config` type fix (closes `ConfigForWidget<'first-5'> = never`).
  - #2074: Ready — doc-only unifier run-19 log, no executable surface.
  - #2072: Ready with minor notes — earlier feedback resolved in `6573248`; Deactivate-guard and UTC-date "bugs" are consistent-by-design; remaining notes (announcement half-window auto-expire, `AnnouncementOverlay` `isActive` index growth, `OptionInput` key-sync contract) are low-severity follow-ups.
- Notes:
  - Branch-safety: #2072 head is `dev-paul` (dev-_); per the standing rule, pushable only for review-comment fixes on a dev-paul→main PR. No fixes were warranted this run, so nothing was pushed to `dev-paul`. #2075/#2074 heads are non-`main`/non-`dev-_`.
  - No code changes pushed this run — the author had already landed all clear fixes (`6573248`), and the three remaining flagged items resolved to false-positives / convention-conflicts / UX judgments on investigation.

- Comments processed: 4 unresolved threads actioned (others were outdated/already-addressed) — 0 fixed, 4 explained
  - #2065: gemini thread on `utils/quizDriveService.ts:716` (also dedup `r.answers` per-response in stats loop) → EXPLAINED: valid but separate grading-semantics concern, out of this PR's row-dedup scope; recommended as a follow-up mirroring `buildResultsSheetData`'s first-occurrence answer filter.
  - #2064: gemini thread suggesting a `userEvent` rewrite of the Escape/Enter tests → EXPLAINED: stylistic, not a correctness issue; the deliberate `fireEvent`+`act()` is required to replicate a browser blur without focusing the element.
  - #2064: claude thread on the Enter test double-blur (line 94) → EXPLAINED: already addressed in current HEAD (`toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1)` present).
  - #2067: claude thread requesting a `totalCalls` assertion (line 1205) → EXPLAINED: already present in current HEAD with a clarifying comment.
- Fixes pushed: 0 (no actionable code-fix comments — open threads were out-of-scope, stylistic, or already satisfied in current HEAD; all code PRs verify clean per their own descriptions)
- Reviews posted: 10 (one structured review per PR)
  - #2070: Ready — clean shared-settings de-duplication; `showColorPicker={false}` correctly avoids a dead `fontColor` control (Clock/TimeTool use `themeColor`).
  - #2069: Ready with minor notes — docs-only; two gemini prose-accuracy nits on the debugger memory log.
  - #2068: Ready — correct root-cause WCAG 2.3.3 fix; gemini's strip-comments test suggestion already in HEAD.
  - #2067: Ready — phantom analytics bucket removed + matching frontend label cleanup; thorough regression tests.
  - #2066: Ready — three verbatim-EN locale values corrected with a regression guard.
  - #2065: Ready with minor notes — question-row dedup correct; flagged the separate answers-dedup follow-up.
  - #2064: Ready — real Escape-cancel bug fixed with the `cancelledRef` pattern; reset-on-blur present so normal saves still work.
  - #2063: Ready with minor notes — docs-only; gemini count nits are correct (bodies→viewer is 4 not 5; NeedDoPutThen panel has 6 labels not 5); 12-total figure is right.
  - #2062: Ready — purely mechanical `@/` alias unification across 7 PLC files.
  - #2043: Ready — docs-only recovery + run-23 scan; flagged overlap with newer #2063 to confirm before merge.
- Notes: No code fixes were pushed this run. None of the open review threads met the clearly-needed + in-scope + unambiguous + safe bar for an automated push to these draft PRs; the substantive ones were either out-of-scope follow-ups (answers-dedup), stylistic preferences, or already satisfied in current HEAD. Per this session's branch policy, this log entry is committed to `claude/compassionate-shannon-ta0tmu` rather than `scheduled-tasks` (the latter is the head of open PR #2070; appending here avoids polluting that PR's diff).

  - #2056: 2 gemini threads on `docs/routines/unifier.md` (fully-qualify meeting paths; move `#2055` to the dedicated PR column) → EXPLAINED + RESOLVED: both marked outdated; current revision (lines 270 and 289) already matches the suggestions. Replied and resolved both threads.
  - #2058, #2057, #2055, #2043: no unresolved actionable threads (Gemini reviews carried no inline comments; #2057's single Blooms-Taxonomy thread was already resolved and Gemini itself advised against mechanical edits to historical audit logs).
- Fixes pushed: 0 (no actionable code-fix comments — the only two were already addressed)
- Reviews posted: 5 (one structured review per PR)
  - #2058: Ready with minor notes — skill path fix verified (`SpecialistSchedule/Settings.tsx:48` reads `featurePermissions`); flagged a `2026-06-24` future-date typo in the journal entry and journal-file overlap with #2057.
  - #2057: Ready — journal-only; flagged two newly-logged advisories (production `dompurify` GHSA-cmwh-pvxp-8882 worth a remediation PR; test-only `ts-deepmerge`).
  - #2056: Ready — doc-only unifier run-17 log; both Gemini nitpicks already satisfied.
  - #2055: Ready — clean mechanical `@/` import-path refactor (6 imports, 5 files); same-dir `./` imports correctly preserved.
  - #2043: Ready — doc recovery + `.gitattributes merge=ours` (built-in driver, correct fix) + timestamp-only perf-baseline bumps.
- Notes:
  - Branch-safety: all 5 head branches are non-`main` / non-`dev-*` → pushable. No fix pushes were required this run.
  - Merge-order coordination flagged on #2058/#2057: both carry the same five `docs/scheduled-tasks/*` journal updates (the skill-fix branch was cut from `scheduled-tasks`), so the second to merge will conflict on those files.

- Comments processed: 8 total — 4 fixed, 4 explained
  - #2045: 3 gemini/claude threads → 2 FIXED (moved `hasCommittedTitleRef` reset into the render body per CLAUDE.md synchronous-ref-flag rule; removed the `onClick` reset), 1 EXPLAINED (outdated — the landed test comment already matched the suggestion).
  - #2046: 2 gemini threads → 2 FIXED (mock factory now captures the real `getTodayStr` via `importOriginal` into a hoisted `defaultGetTodayStr.current` ref; `beforeEach` restores it — removes duplicated date logic).
  - #2048: 2 gemini threads → 2 EXPLAINED (already addressed): commit `16b8b57` had already rewritten lines 135/225 to the render-body reset wording.
  - #2049: 1 claude thread → no action (self-verification note confirming the RevealGrid finding, not a change request).
  - #2043, #2044, #2047: no unresolved threads.
- Fixes pushed: 2
  - #2045 / `nightly/dashboard-layout-2026-06-22` — `fix(pr-2045): reset hasCommittedTitleRef in render body per CLAUDE.md ref pattern`.
  - #2046 / `nightly/widgets-2026-06-22` — `fix(pr-2046): capture real getTodayStr in mock factory to avoid duplicating date logic`.
- Reviews posted: 7 (one structured review per PR)
  - #2049: Ready — Monday audit docs + thorough `useTemplateStore` test; flagged RevealGrid no-`onClick` button as the most actionable follow-up.
  - #2048: Ready — doc-only debugger run-19 log; gemini wording suggestions already incorporated.
  - #2047: Ready — recovers 5 silently-dropped tests via the established mock-hoisting pattern.
  - #2046: Ready — local-date fix matching the widget's convention; test-DRY review note addressed.
  - #2045: Ready — surgical double-write fix; ref-reset now aligned with repo convention.
  - #2044: Ready — minimal, well-tested DE locale fix.
  - #2043: Ready — doc recovery; flagged the recurring `main → dev-paul` clobber of `unifier.md` for a permanent merge-strategy fix.
- Notes:
  - Branch-safety: all 7 head branches are non-`main` / non-`dev-*` → pushable. Two required fix pushes (#2045, #2046).
  - Local verification for both fix pushes ran on Node 22 (env wants 24): `tsc --noEmit` (0 errors), `eslint --max-warnings 0` (clean), and the affected vitest suites (DraggableWindow 55/55, ScheduleWidget 29/29) all passed; full CI on Node 24 remains the authoritative gate.

- PRs reviewed: 4 (all open PRs; all base `dev-paul`, none `main`/`dev-*`)
  - #2035 — audit(scheduled-tasks): Sunday 2026-06-21 — admin-config audit + TextWidget MEDIUM fix (head `scheduled-tasks`)
  - #2034 — docs(unifier): run 22 — staleness scan (head `nightly/unifier-log-2026-06-21`)
  - #2030 — pr-review: nightly PR review log — 2026-06-20 (head `claude/compassionate-shannon-dzln7f`)
  - #2029 — fix(widgets/expectations): use shared Toggle in Settings panel (head `scheduled/expectations-toggle`)
- Comments processed: 1 actionable thread — 0 fixed, 1 explained (all other threads empty/resolved)
  - #2034: 1 unresolved-but-outdated thread (claude) requesting revert of inflated `actualDurationMs` baselines → EXPLAINED, no fix: the current diff already addresses it — only `generatedAt` changed in `baseline.json`/`dashboard-baseline.json`; timing medians are unchanged. Replied marking resolved.
  - #2029: 1 thread (gemini optional-chaining) already `is_resolved:true` from the 2026-06-20 run → no action.
  - #2035, #2030: no review comments.
- Fixes pushed: 0 (no comment required a code change)
- Reviews posted: 3
  - #2035: Ready with minor notes — TextWidget admin building defaults (`fontFamily`/`fontColor`/`verticalAlign`) are correct and well-tested (`isHexColor`/`Number.isFinite`/`isWidgetFontFamily`/enum validation; 3 new test cases; panel mirrors Stations). Flagged scope: `scheduled-tasks` head carries 42 changed files, ~38 unrelated to the described change (accumulated-divergence pattern, same as #2016) — human should confirm the bundle is intended for the nightly→`dev-paul` release flow.
  - #2034: Ready — doc-only unifier run 22; the inline baseline concern is resolved.
  - #2030: Ready — doc-only nightly review-log entry.
  - #2029: skipped (not re-reviewed) — already carries a full automated Claude review from 2026-06-20 and has no new commits since; re-reviewing would be noise.
- Notes:
  - Branch-safety: all 4 head branches are non-`main` / non-`dev-*` → pushable. Phase 1 produced no fixes, so no pushes to any PR branch.
  - This log is committed to `claude/compassionate-shannon-l4ziui` (this session's development branch) rather than `scheduled-tasks`, because `scheduled-tasks` is the head of open PR #2035 — committing there would pollute that PR's diff. Consistent with prior runs (#2030 used `claude/compassionate-shannon-dzln7f`).

- Comments processed: 5 actionable threads across 4 PRs — 1 fixed, 4 explained (remaining open threads were `is_outdated:true` style/doc nits, left per the be-frugal guideline)
  - #2020: gemini `buildGLResponsesCSV` thread (not outdated) → FIXED. Map answer lookup (O(N+M)) + `typeof … === 'number'` guards so a 0-epoch timestamp renders an ISO date. The two claude threads (missing `sessionId`, react-hooks/refs comment) were already addressed at HEAD → replied.
  - #2019: gemini render-body-reset thread → already implemented at HEAD (replied). claude "drop the eslint-disable" thread → EXPLAINED no-change: verified empirically that removing the directive errors `Cannot update ref during render react-hooks/refs` under `--max-warnings 0`; the rule is real here and the suppression is required.
  - #2021: all 3 claude threads (rename, `.exists` guard, reuse `accessPerm?.config`) already addressed at HEAD → replied to the not-outdated one.
  - #2023: open gemini doc-accuracy note (`checkAccess` helper doesn't exist; checks are inline) → surfaced in the posted review; not pushed (docs log, outdated thread).
- Fixes pushed: 1
  - #2020 / `nightly/state-data-2026-06-19` — `buildGLResponsesCSV` stepId→answer Map + 0-epoch timestamp guards; type-check ✓ lint ✓ prettier ✓ tests 12/12 ✓.
- Reviews posted: 9 (one structured review per PR)
  - #2022: Ready — documented anti-pattern removal + strong regression tests; nit: undocumented accentText fix.
  - #2021: Ready — real accessLevel bypass fix; noted pre-existing `.exists` gap in `transcribeVideoWithGemini` as follow-up.
  - #2020: Ready — dedup fix + my timestamp/perf follow-up.
  - #2019: Ready with minor notes — pattern-consistent onBlur guard; confirm the regression test landed (not seen in diff).
  - #2018: Ready — trivial locale fix, consolidated into the backgrounds locale sweep test.
  - #2016: Needs changes — poll cap is correct, but the `scheduled-tasks` head carries 36 files vs the 5-line described fix; scope/description mismatch flagged.
  - #2023, #2017, #2013: Ready (docs logs); flagged #2013↔#2023 run-21 overlap and the #2023 `checkAccess` wording.
- Notes:
  - Branch-safety: no PR targets `main`; all head branches pushable. Only #2020 needed a fix push.
  - This log committed to the designated working branch `claude/compassionate-shannon-e8i4ou` (not `scheduled-tasks`, which is itself the head of the open, scope-flagged #2016).

- Comments processed: 11 total — 7 fixed, 3 explained-no-op, 1 skipped (author rationale present)
  - #1975: 4 unresolved threads — gemini HIGH Enter-commit double-fire on unmount blur in `NewFolderInput` + claude's matching pre-existing-risk note → FIXED with one `if (!e.currentTarget?.isConnected) return;` guard on `onBlur`; 2 claude test-gap threads (NewFolderInput has no regression test) → EXPLAINED (component is non-exported; needs full-FolderSidebar harness that actually unmounts the input — flagged for manual follow-up).
  - #1977: 4 unresolved threads — 3 gemini type-safety threads (remove `as unknown as`/`Record<string, unknown>` casts) → FIXED via `LocaleWithShareCollection` interface + `keyof ShareCollectionSection`-typed key list; 1 claude FR terminology thread (`Établissement` vs established `bâtiment`) → FIXED to `Bâtiment`/`— Sélectionner un bâtiment —`.

- Fixes pushed: 3
  - #1975 / `nightly/dashboard-layout-2026-06-15` (08dda10) — `NewFolderInput.onBlur` `isConnected` guard against the Enter-unmount double-commit. type-check ✓ lint ✓ format ✓ existing rename test ✓
  - #1977 / `nightly/admin-config-2026-06-15` (7f70499) — FR `building`/`selectBuilding` aligned to "bâtiment" + type-safe `shareCollectionLocales.test.ts`. type-check ✓ lint ✓ format ✓ 11/11 locale tests ✓
  - #1972 / `nightly/unifier-log-2026-06-15` (d4e8b74) — `D3-E12` → `D3-E13` in run log. prettier ✓ (doc-only)
- Reviews posted: 10 (one structured review per PR)
  - #1980: Ready — substitute-portal hook tests (20); mock cleanup already correct.
  - #1979: Ready — doc-only debugger run #18 log.
  - #1978: Ready — additive trailing-slash AGS coverage (528→532).
  - #1977: Ready — root-cause i18n fix + verbatim guard; type-safety/terminology nits resolved.
  - #1976: Ready — root-cause `proportionsValid` range-guard fix with FAIL-before/PASS-after tests.

  - #1972: Ready — doc-only unifier run 16; numbering fix applied.
  - #1971: Ready with minor notes — large shared-atom Quiz/VA monitor/results refactor into `main`; 56/57 threads resolved; CI `pending`, recommend confirming green + manual live-session smoke test (touches live monitor/results path).
  - #1951: Ready — boardsModal/collection i18n (~335 values) + regression suite; all 6 threads resolved.
- Notes:
  - Branch-safety: all 9 nightly/scheduled head branches are non-`main` / non-`dev-*` → pushable; only #1975, #1977, #1972 needed fix pushes. #1971's head is `dev-paul` (matches `dev-*`, read-only) — review comment only, no push.
  - Verification ran on Node 22 locally (project wants Node 24); type-check/lint/format/tests all green for the touched files. CI on Node 24 remains the authoritative gate.

- Comments processed: 4 total — 0 fixed, 4 already-addressed/no-op (all 4 resolved + replied)
  - #1958: 1 gemini thread (MEDIUM) — already addressed in HEAD. `launchEndpoints.ts` already caches `existingGradeLink.data()` in `gradeLinkData` with explicit `string | null` typing (no repeated `.data()`, no `any`, no assertion). Replied + resolved.
  - #1957: 1 gemini thread (MEDIUM) — already addressed in HEAD. `fr.json` `addStationsTip` already reads "…effectuer une rotation automatique des élèves…". Replied + resolved.
  - #1956: 1 gemini thread (MEDIUM) — already addressed in HEAD. CapsLock test already wraps dispatch in `try…finally` with listener cleanup. Replied + resolved.
  - #1955: 1 gemini thread (HIGH) — already addressed in HEAD. `isBlocked` already derives the date string via local-time `getFullYear()/getMonth()/getDate()` instead of `.toISOString()`. Replied + resolved.
  - #1960, #1959, #1954, #1953, #1951 (resolved), #1945, #1943 (all 7 prior threads resolved): no open review comments requiring action.

  - Needs human review (scope, not defect): #1943 — 100+ file `dev-paul → main` integration PR; highest risk in the `dashboardCanvasStore`/`DashboardContext` refactor. New `rollout_requests` Firestore rule verified (identity-pinned, `hasOnly` allow-list, admin-only triage); `functions/src/index.ts` change is additive + adds an SSRF `maxRedirects: 0` guard. CI status pending at review time.

- Comments processed: 11 total — 8 fixed, 3 already-addressed/no-op
  - #1944: 4 gemini threads — 3 FIXED (HIGH: NaN-sanitize `trim.start`/`end` centrally in `clampTrimStart`/`clampTrimEnd` so `video.currentTime` can't be assigned NaN; MEDIUM: sync `onClose` ref in render body instead of `useLayoutEffect`; MEDIUM: drop now-unused `useLayoutEffect` import). 1 outdated thread skipped. Note: the suggested `react-hooks/refs` disable was _not_ needed — the rule doesn't flag this assignment (unused-directive under `--max-warnings 0`).
  - #1951: 1 gemini thread (MEDIUM) — FIXED. `fr.json` `pinnedEmpty` had Cyrillic `инг` in `Épингlez`; corrected to Latin `Épinglez`. Scanned all four locales for Cyrillic-block chars — none remaining.
  - #1950: 1 gemini thread (MEDIUM) — FIXED. `isCorrect = pointsEarned >= max` marked every answer correct for a 0-point question (`0 >= 0`) and used float comparison; switched to `matched === total` (equivalent for `max > 0`, correct for `max === 0`) + added a 0-point regression test.
  - #1949: 1 gemini thread (MEDIUM) — FIXED. Extracted the duplicated input/textarea/select/contentEditable check into a file-level `isTypingFieldActive()` helper and applied it to all six keydown guard sites.
  - #1947: 3 gemini threads (MEDIUM) — FIXED. Simplified the negative-tick fraction expr to `Math.abs(valNumer) % denom` (distinct from the `Math.abs(valNumer % denom)` band-aid the PR rejected — keeps `% denom`); corrected two test descriptions (`-1 3/4` is first sub-tick _above -2_; `fractionLabel` renders `2/4`, not `1/2`).
  - #1943: 7 threads — all already addressed via #1944 (author replies on each thread). No action.

  - #1953 Ready; #1952 Ready; #1951 Ready (Cyrillic fix pushed); #1950 Ready (0-point fix pushed); #1949 Ready (helper extraction pushed); #1948 Ready (dup of #1946); #1947 Ready (simplification pushed); #1946 Ready (dup of #1948); #1945 Ready; #1944 Ready (all threads resolved); #1943 **Needs changes** (CI red — see below).
- Notes:
  - Branch-safety: #1943 head is `dev-paul` (matches `dev-*`) → read-only, review-only, no push. All other heads (`nightly/*`, `claude/*`, `scheduled-tasks`) are pushable; 5 fixes went to their own head branches. No pushes to `main` or `dev-paul`.
  - **#1943 CI is red** but only on `format:check` for `docs/routines/unifier.md` (Prettier drift) — all other jobs (type-check, Unit, E2E, Build, Firestore Rules, CodeQL) pass. This is exactly what **#1946**/**#1948** fix; landing one into dev-paul and re-running #1943's CI clears it. The 7 inline review threads on #1943 are already handled via #1944.
  - **Duplicate Prettier fix flagged:** #1946 (run-14 baseline-fix branch) and #1948 (run-15 build-tooling branch) carry the _identical_ reformat of `docs/routines/unifier.md`. Only one is needed — merge one and the other becomes empty/conflicting. #1945 also edits the same file (run-14 log content) and will need a trivial merge-order reconciliation.
  - Forward note: #1952's new "partial-credit `isCorrect` invariant" gotcha documents `pointsEarned >= pointsMax`; #1950 was refined to `matched === total` (handles the `max === 0` case). Worth syncing the gotcha wording when convenient.

- Comments processed: 9 total — 7 fixed, 2 explained
  - #1939: 1 HIGH gemini thread — removing the `DraggableWindow` Alt+Backspace branch left `Alt+Backspace` unhandled because `DashboardView` only matched `Delete` → FIXED (global handler now clears on Delete+Backspace under Alt/Shift; plain Backspace stays a no-op).
  - #1936: 5 threads (3 HIGH stale `.root` keys in DE/ES/FR + 2 MEDIUM redundant test casts) → all 5 FIXED (translated `.root` to match the `"No Collection"` EN source, removed casts, extended the regression test to guard `.root`).
  - #1938: 1 MEDIUM gemini thread — duplicate `normalizeSession` backlog row → FIXED (removed; already tracked on the 06-08/06-09 rows).
  - #1942: 1 MEDIUM gemini thread (outdated) — Run Log PR-number column → EXPLAINED (no fix): committed table already has the PR in its own 5th column.
  - #1933: 1 MEDIUM gemini thread (outdated) — 64-vs-63 widget-count discrepancy → EXPLAINED (no fix): reviewer's own guidance is not to auto-reconcile historical audit logs; the PR itself reconciles it with an explicit awk verification.

- Reviews posted: 10 (one structured review per PR)
  - #1942: Ready — doc-only unifier run 13 log; outdated table nit already resolved.
  - #1941: Ready — `@/` alias substitution; behavior-preserving (one bonus double-mock cleanup in escapeInteraction.test.tsx).
  - #1940: Ready with minor notes — baseline refresh is more than timing-only: `dashboard-baseline.json` `totalShellRenders` (a deterministic primary metric) dropped across nearly every scenario (the DashboardContext-split win); recommended correcting the PR body.
  - #1939: Ready — handler-ownership consolidation; the Alt+Backspace gap raised in review is fixed.
  - #1938: Ready — doc-only debugger run 14 log; duplicate backlog row removed.
  - #1937: Ready — genuine SSRF redirect-bypass fix mirroring fetchExternalProxy; good test.
  - #1936: Ready — locale placeholder fix + parity-enforcing test; all gemini follow-ups addressed.
  - #1935: Ready — Set-based dedup fence matching 5 prior fixes; well-tested.
  - #1934: Ready — phase sentinel for Reset disable; one-line + regression test.
  - #1933: Ready — high-quality activity-wall building-defaults wiring (pure validated helper + 8 tests); journal updates doc-only.
- Notes:
  - Branch-safety: all 10 head branches are non-`main`/non-`dev-*` → pushable; 3 required fix pushes.
  - #1933 head is `scheduled-tasks` (this log's branch); appending today's entry here and pushing follows the POST-TASK workflow.

- Comments processed: 6 total — 3 fixed, 3 explained (all from gemini-code-assist)
  - #1923: 2 threads — FIXED. `minimizeAllWidgets`/`restoreAllWidgets` now read `activeIdRef.current` and drop `activeId` from deps for reference stability. Also converted the `if (!activeId) return` early-return guards in both (the suggestion only showed the `d.id` line; leaving the guard on the closure while removing the dep would have made it stale). `activeIdRef.current` is render-body-synced. type-check ✓ lint ✓ tests ✓.
  - #1926: 1 thread — FIXED. Added `const answers = r.answers ?? []` nullish guard before the dedup loop and switched the map value type to `R['answers'][number]`. type-check ✓ lint ✓ tests ✓ (17/17).
  - #1931: 1 thread — EXPLAINED. gemini's `lastCommittedState` notify-bailout is a sound, low-risk optimization but changes the brand-new store's notify semantics in a concurrent-rendering-sensitive path; recommended to the author but not auto-applied (design call, not a correctness defect).
  - #1925: 1 thread — EXPLAINED. Test-cleanup hardening (centralize element disposal in `afterEach`) is an enhancement; suite passes 21/21 and the suggestion is a wholesale `describe` rewrite, not a targeted fix.
  - #1924: 1 thread — EXPLAINED. Reverting durations to 3-run medians while surgically updating only the `gl.type25` commit count is a baseline-methodology decision that would undo the PR's stated purpose; left to the author.
  - #1930, #1929, #1928, #1927, #1922, #1915, #1910: no review comments.
- Fixes pushed: 2 (each to its own PR head branch — no pushes to `main`/`dev-*`)
  - #1923 / `perf/dashboard-canvas-pass` — `fix(pr-1923): make minimizeAllWidgets/restoreAllWidgets reference-stable`
  - #1926 / `nightly/state-data-2026-06-10` — `fix(pr-1926): guard answers iteration with ?? [] and use R['answers'][number]`
- Reviews posted: 12 (all COMMENT event)
  - #1931 Ready w/ notes (stacked on #1923 — merge that first; adopt notify bailout); #1930 Ready (test-only, faithful wiring; flagged VA's non-filtering of empty classIds/rosterIds as a possible follow-up); #1929 **Needs changes** (described "audit-only" but diff vs base `main` carries ~4,000+ lines of source — GuidedLearningEditor +1083, new ScreenCaptureModal +464, VideoActivityEditor +463, Quiz/VA editor modals, workflow files — `scheduled-tasks` has diverged from `main`; reconcile base/scope before merging to `main`); #1928 Ready; #1927 Ready; #1926 Ready (defensive guard pushed); #1925 Ready w/ notes (test-cleanup hardening deferred); #1924 Ready w/ notes (single-run snapshot noise); #1923 Ready w/ notes (ref-stability pushed; base of #1931); #1922 Ready w/ notes (run-11 unifier.md collides with #1910); #1915 Ready; #1910 Ready w/ notes (duplicate run-11 of unifier.md, collides with #1922).
- Notes:
  - Branch-safety: no open PR head is `main` or `dev-*`; all heads pushable. Both fixes went to PR head branches. No pushes to `main` or `dev-paul`. This log committed to `scheduled-tasks` (fair-game) per task instructions.
  - **#1929 scope discrepancy (flag for human):** the audit PR's base is `main` and `scheduled-tasks` is far ahead of it, so the PR would land a large editor refactor into production `main`. Either retarget to `dev-paul` or re-sync `scheduled-tasks` to `main`. (This log commit rides on that same branch but is docs-only.)
  - **Duplicate run-11 unifier logs:** #1910 (2026-06-09) and #1922 (2026-06-10) both bump `docs/routines/unifier.md` to "Run count: 11" and edit overlapping rows → conflict on second merge; flagged on both.
  - #1929 journals also surface a real Firestore **MEDIUM** (`pollVotes` subcollection writes unrestricted for all authenticated users) worth a dedicated `firestore.rules` fix PR.
  - #1923 touches `context/DashboardContext.tsx` heavily but identity-preserving; #1931 adds a new `dashboardCanvasStore.ts` with conditional-`use()` fallback so the ~185 `useDashboard()` consumers are untouched. No new `WidgetType`/`WidgetRegistry.ts` config-merge or `firestore.rules` match-block changes in the code-bearing PRs, so those checks were not triggered.

  - #1902: 2 threads — FIXED. Removed redundant `as never` / `as { … }` casts in the normalize test; fields are declared optionals on `VideoActivitySession`, sessionOptions now uses real `VideoActivitySessionOptions` fields. type-check ✓ tests ✓ (19/19).

- Notes:
  - Branch-safety: no open PR head is `main` or `dev-*`; all heads pushable. All 5 fixes went to PR head branches. No pushes to `main`.
  - **Duplicate-PR cluster flagged:** #1889 and #1897 make the identical `utils/`→`@/` conversion (#1897 also converts the `FONTS` import; more complete). Their memory-log PRs (#1890 ↔ #1898, both "run 10") and the debugger logs (#1896 ↔ #1904, both "run 11") similarly overlap and will conflict on second merge. Recommended in reviews that the team land one of each pair.
  - #1903 touches `functions/src/lti/nrpsStore.ts` — additive title-preservation logic only; `persistLtiLaunchContext` signature unchanged. No new `WidgetType`, no `WidgetRegistry.ts`/`DashboardContext.tsx` config-merge, no `firestore.rules` changes across the batch, so widget-registration and rules-match-block checks were not triggered.

- Comments processed: 1 total — 1 fixed, 0 explained
  - #1894: 1 unresolved thread (gemini-code-assist) — FIXED. The new regression test called `setupMocks()` _after_ setting `useImageUpload`'s `fnA` return value; since `setupMocks()` re-mocks `useImageUpload` with a fresh `vi.fn()`, it silently clobbered `fnA` so the first render never used it. Reordered `setupMocks()` ahead of the `fnA` mock. type-check ✓ lint ✓ tests ✓ (5/5 in Dock.test.tsx). Replied and resolved the thread.
  - #1887: 1 thread already resolved (NextUp maxWidth `30cqmin` fix from 2026-06-06) — no action.

- Notes:
  - Branch-safety: no open PR head is `main` or `dev-*`; all heads were pushable. The single fix went to its PR head branch (`nightly/dashboard-2026-06-07`). No pushes to `main`.
  - All 9 nightly PRs are small, focused bug/i18n/refactor/doc changes; none add a new `WidgetType` or touch `WidgetRegistry.ts`/`DashboardContext.tsx` config-merge/`firestore.rules`, so the widget-registration and rules-match-block checks were not triggered. #1891 touches `functions/src/index.ts` (two additive `if` statements — no signature change) and #1887 touches `types.ts`/`utils/adminBuildingConfig.ts` (comment-only).

- Comments processed: 2 threads — 2 fixed, 0 explained
  - #1887: 1 thread — FIXED. gemini-code-assist correctly noted `maxWidth: 'min(120px, 30cqmin)'` still hard-caps at 120px (since `min()` picks the smaller value), defeating the PR's scaling goal. Changed to `maxWidth: '30cqmin'` so the session name scales with the widget. type-check ✓ lint ✓ format ✓.
  - #1886: 1 thread — FIXED. Removed the duplicate "D4 hooks/ complete (run 9)" note, keeping the more detailed entry (the one noting the `useImageUpload.ts` Prettier fix). Did NOT apply gemini's literal suggestion text, which would have duplicated the adjacent "D4 context/ complete (run 8)" line; removed the redundant line instead. format ✓.
  - #1885, #1884, #1883: no review comments.

- Reviews posted: 5 (all COMMENT event)
  - #1887 Ready w/ minor notes (css-scaling.md Completed entry still records the superseded `min(120px, 30cqmin)` value — doc-only); #1886 Ready; #1885 Ready (verified `SettingsLabel` `icon?` prop signature; `Settings2` still used); #1884 Ready (mechanical `@/` alias, `./` sibling imports untouched); #1883 Ready (verified `ScaledEmptyState` requires `icon`+`title`; usage correct).
- Notes:
  - Branch-safety: no open PR head is `main` or `dev-*`; all heads were pushable. Both fixes went to their respective PR head branches (`scheduled-tasks` for #1887, `nightly/unifier-log-2026-06-06` for #1886). No pushes to `main`.
  - Verified component signatures before reviewing: `components/common/SettingsLabel.tsx` (optional `icon` rendered at `w-3 h-3`, label `mb-2`) and `components/common/ScaledEmptyState.tsx` (`icon` + `title` required, `subtitle` optional, default icon color `text-slate-300`). Both #1885 and #1883 use them correctly.
  - All five PRs are small, mechanical/doc-level changes — no new widgets, no `types.ts`/`WidgetRegistry.ts`/`DashboardContext.tsx`/Firestore-rules changes, so the widget-registration and rules-match-block checks were not triggered.

- Comments processed: 6 threads — 0 fixed, 6 explained
  - #1879: 1 thread — explained, no fix. gemini's `undefined`-property cleanup is unnecessary: feature config is saved via `FeaturePermissionsManager.savePermission` with a full-document `setDoc` (no `{ merge: true }`), so `ignoreUndefinedProperties` drops a `fontFamily: undefined` reset-to-Global correctly. Also matches the sibling Checklist/ConceptWeb panels.
  - #1876: 2 threads — explained, already addressed in `4bd04b2` (pluralized `modeChipAriaWithCount_*`/`triggerAriaWithAbsent_*` keys already present in test + all locales).
  - #1875: 1 thread (outdated) — explained, mocks already use the `@/` alias in HEAD (active, not inert).
  - #1874: 1 thread (outdated) — explained, the `newDurationSeconds === 0` else-branch is already present in HEAD (`useBreathing.ts:83–89`).
  - #1870: 1 thread — explained, no fix. MathTools grid column headers becoming orphan `<label>`s is a design tradeoff; `SettingsLabel` deliberately always renders `<label>` per its own documented rationale. Deferred to human/design owner; suggested an `as`/`role` escape hatch as the clean path.
  - #1864, #1861, #1838: inline threads already carried author "Fixed/Valid" replies (or are resolved) at HEAD — no action.
  - #1878, #1877, #1873, #1872, #1871, #1852: no review comments.
- Fixes pushed: 0 — every actionable comment was already addressed in a later commit, not-a-defect (evidence-backed), or a design tradeoff for human judgment. No branch pushes this run other than this log update.

  - #1879 Ready w/ minor notes (incidental scheduled-tasks journal-doc churn riding along); #1878 Ready; #1877 Ready; #1876 Ready (native DE/ES/FR copy spot-check suggested); #1875 Ready; #1874 Ready; #1873 Ready; #1872 Ready w/ minor notes (run-8 ledger dup vs #1852); #1871 Ready; #1870 Ready w/ minor notes (a11y thread deferred); #1864 Ready w/ minor notes (changelog overlap w/ #1861); #1861 Ready w/ minor notes (overlap w/ #1864); #1852 Ready w/ minor notes (superseded by #1872); #1838 Ready w/ minor notes (author-flagged live Classroom smoke test).
- Notes:
  - Branch-safety: no open PR head is `main` or `dev-*`; all branches were pushable. No fixes required pushing this run. No pushes to `main`.
  - Cross-PR coordination flagged for humans: (1) #1864 and #1861 both add a 2026-06-04 entry to `public/changelog.json` → `dev-paul` (conflict/duplicate risk — reconcile or sequence); (2) #1852 (06-04) and #1872 (06-05) are both "run 8" `docs/routines/unifier.md` updates → `dev-paul` (#1872 supersedes #1852); (3) #1879's diff carries accumulated `docs/scheduled-tasks/*.md` journal updates beyond the Stations feature.
  - CI status was not surfaced via the commit-status API (`total_count: 0` on all heads — these branches validate through GitHub Actions check_runs, not legacy statuses); merge-readiness is based on diff review + each PR's stated `pnpm run validate` result rather than an independently re-run CI.

  - #1859 Ready w/ minor notes; #1858 Ready; #1857 Ready; #1856 Ready (pushed gender fix); #1855 Ready; #1854 Ready; #1853 Ready; #1852 Ready; #1851 Ready; #1850 Ready w/ minor notes; #1849 Ready w/ minor notes (changelog version-ordering vs #1847; base is `main`); #1847 Ready w/ minor notes (coordinate version ordering with #1849); #1838 Ready w/ minor notes (author-flagged live Classroom smoke test).
- Notes:
  - Branch-safety: no open PR head is `main` or `dev-*`, so all branches were pushable. Only #1856 needed a fix; the rest were explanation-only. No pushes to `main`. #1849 targets `main` as its base but the push (had there been one) would have been to its head `claude/vibrant-darwin-bHcj5`, not `main`.
  - Cross-PR coordination flagged for humans: #1847 (`2026.06.03.1`, base `dev-paul`) and #1849 (`2026.06.03.2`, base `main`) both prepend to `public/changelog.json` and describe overlapping Schoology work — version ordering / dedup needs a human decision.

- Comments processed: 12 total — 8 fixed, 4 explained
  - #1814 (classroomAddonAuth.ts, gemini): **explained** — already addressed by the author in 066d873 (response-body drain added); thread left unresolved but fix is in.
  - #1815 (Results.tsx, gemini): **explained** — already addressed by the author in 8fcc0b8 (empty-session early return returns `avgScore: null`); thread left unresolved but fix is in.
  - #1824 (unifier.md, gemini): **explained** — the requested "2 instances at lines ~67, ~171" wording is already present on the branch (comment is outdated).
  - #1826 (AnnotationCanvas.tsx, gemini ×2): **fixed** — added a render-body-synced `drawingStateRef`; window pointerup/pointercancel listeners now read it and the effect deps reduce to `[isDrawing]`, so listeners register once per stroke (targeted `react-hooks/refs` disable, per #1802 precedent).
  - #1828 (de.json / fr.json / widgetStickersLocales.test.ts, gemini ×3): **fixed** — added `filterAll`/`filterFavorites`/`filterMine`/`reorganizeSticker`/`favoriteSticker` to all four locales and to `REQUIRED_WIDGET_STICKERS_KEYS`.
  - #1829 (organizationInvites.ts + .test.ts, gemini ×2): **fixed** — the dot-domain check now uses `indexOf('.', atIdx + 1) < atIdx + 2`, rejecting `user@.co.uk`; extended the regression test.
  - #1830 (debugger.md, gemini ×2): **fixed** — escaped the absolute-value pipes (`\|...\|`) and restored the table to 4 columns.
  - #1831 (ai-integration.md, gemini): **fixed** — corrected the client caller name to `recommendVideoForActivity`.
- Fixes pushed: 6
  - #1829 / `nightly/build-tooling-2026-06-03` — reject email domains beginning with a dot for multi-dot TLDs (+ test).
  - #1828 / `nightly/admin-config-2026-06-03` — add missing filter/favorite/reorder sticker keys to all locales (+ test array).
  - #1830 / `nightly/debugger-log-2026-06-03` — escape pipes in NumberLine epsilon-guard log entry, restore 4-column table.
  - #1826 / `nightly/dashboard-layout-2026-06-03` — sync drawing state via ref so window listeners register once per stroke.
  - #1831 / `scheduled-tasks` — correct ai-integration.md caller name to `recommendVideoForActivity` (this commit).
  - (Each fix verified: type-check ✓ lint ✓ tests ✓ / format-check ✓ for doc-only changes.)
- Reviews posted: 17 (one structured review per open PR)
  - Notable: #1821 (Schoology LTI) — Ready with notes; no blocking issues found in the JWT/rules surfaces reviewed (RS256 pinned, all secret LTI collections server-only, dedicated rules test), but recommended a human security sign-off given size + LTI/OIDC/grade-writeback sensitivity. #1816 & #1814 both rewrite the `linkClassroomCourse` trust-anchor/transaction seam — flagged to confirm clean merge order. All other PRs assessed Ready or Ready-with-minor-notes.
- Notes:
  - Branch-safety: all 17 PR heads are feature/nightly/`scheduled-tasks` branches (none are `main` or `dev-*`), so all were pushable. Fixes pushed only to the respective PR head branches; no pushes to `main` or `dev-paul`.
  - This log + the #1831 doc fix are committed and pushed to `scheduled-tasks` per task instructions (it is a fair-game branch; pushing updates open PR #1831, which is the intended target of its own review-comment fix).

## 2026-06-02

- PRs reviewed: 8

  - #1807 — fix(deps): pin path-to-regexp to patched versions to close HIGH ReDoS advisories (head `deps/path-to-regexp-redos-fix`, base `dev-paul`)
- Comments processed: 6 total — 3 fixed, 3 explained
  - #1800 (AddonShell.tsx, gemini): **fixed** — `AddonSelect` `onBlur` now guards `e.relatedTarget` for null before the `contains` check, so a non-focusable blur target (e.g. the dropdown scrollbar) no longer prematurely closes the popover.
  - #1800 (TeacherReviewRoute.tsx, gemini): **explained** — code already resets `quizData` to null when `quizId` is absent; the suggested `useSyncedState` hook is a new shared abstraction (architectural call) and the cross-quiz-transition case is an edge case for this single-session route.
  - #1801 (GuidedLearningPlayer.tsx, gemini): **fixed** — replaced the post-paint `useEffect` ref sync with a synchronous render-body assignment per CLAUDE.md, plus a targeted `react-hooks/refs` disable for the v7 false-positive.
  - #1802 (DraggableWindow.tsx, gemini): **fixed** — corrected the `shouldRenderSettings` latch comment to describe the actual `!shouldRenderSettings` guard instead of a nonexistent `prevFlipped` (comment-only).
  - #1804 (widgetWindowLocales.test.ts, gemini): **explained** — recursive full-parity refactor is a test-design enhancement that would broaden scope beyond the PR's 9 keys and risk surfacing unrelated pre-existing gaps; left for a human.
  - #1806 (debugger.md, gemini): **explained** — reviewer's `.values()` suggestion is incorrect; #1803 iterates `questionsById` directly with `[qId, q]` destructuring (≡ `.entries()`), so the existing wording is accurate.
- Fixes pushed: 3
  - #1800 / `claude/serene-meitner-EzK6N` — guard `AddonSelect` `onBlur` against null `relatedTarget` (type-check ✓ lint ✓).
  - #1801 / `nightly/widgets-2026-06-02` — sync `answeredStepsRef` in render body instead of `useEffect` (type-check ✓ lint ✓ tests ✓ 3946 pass).
  - #1802 / `nightly/dashboard-layout-2026-06-02` — correct `shouldRenderSettings` latch comment (lint ✓ format ✓).
- Reviews posted: 8 (one structured `## Automated Code Review` comment per PR above)
- Notes:
  - Branch-safety: no PR targets `main`; all eight head branches are non-`main`/non-`dev-*` and pushable. Pushes went only to the three PR head branches with actionable fixes. This log committed on `scheduled-tasks` per task instructions (not a `dev-*`/`main` branch).

- Reviews posted: 11 (structured review comment on every open PR)
- Notes:
  - Branch-safety: #1781 head `dev-paul` matches `dev-*` → treated read-only (review comment only, no push). All other heads (`nightly/*`, `claude/*`) are pushable. #1781's one prior inline thread was already author-resolved.
  - #1781 CI status reads `pending` (0 checks reported) on head SHA — flagged in the review to confirm green before merging to `main`.
  - `scheduled-tasks` is not the head of any open PR this run, so this log is committed and pushed to `scheduled-tasks` directly.

  - PR #1753 (`nightly/debugger-log-2026-05-29`) — commit `c5104b2` `fix(pr-1753): wrap DiceWidget identifier in backticks in debugger log`. Wrapped the `DiceWidget` identifier in backticks per gemini-code-assist suggestion; prettier rewrapped column padding in adjacent rows.
  - PR #1752 (`nightly/build-tooling-2026-05-29`) — commit `25eb17c` `fix(pr-1752): escape single-quote in sanitizePrompt for attribute-breakout defense`. Added `"'": '&#39;'` to `ESCAPE_MAP` and extended the regex character class; added a regression test asserting `it's → it&#39;s`. 7/7 tests pass.
  - PR #1748 (`nightly/unifier-log-2026-05-29`) — commit `99f7743` `fix(pr-1748): prefix admin paths with components/admin/ in D5 backlog table`. Prefixed `SaveAsTemplateModal.tsx` and `Organization/OrganizationPanel.tsx` with `components/admin/` to match the rest of the D5 table.

Added `htmlFor`/`id` pairs for 5 form controls using React `useId()` for collision-free ids across multiple Random widget instances. Verified: type-check ✓ lint ✓.
- Reviews posted: 9 (all open PRs received a structured review comment).
- Notes:
  - Branch safety: all 4 fixes were pushed to head branches of PRs targeting `dev-paul`. No push to `main` or `dev-paul`.
  - PR #1750 had a gemini suggestion to swap `TestConfig` for `TextConfig` in the new test file, claiming type-check would fail. Declined — `pnpm run type-check` exits clean; the explicit `as [Partial<TestConfig>]` cast on `mock.calls[0]` resolves the generic at the call site. Explained on the thread.
  - PR #1754 (head `scheduled-tasks`) — no reviewer comments; only the gemini summary review existed.

Drops the `mb-3` Tailwind-class-collision with the SettingsLabel default `mb-2`; adds `mb-0` on the two SettingsLabels inside flex-headers / `space-y-3` sections to preserve the original spacing. Verified: type-check ✓ lint ✓ prettier ✓.
  - PR #1724 (`nightly/unify-toast-routines-2026-05-28`) — commit `09d9bb0` `fix(pr-1724): wrap async saveRoutine in try/catch + guard nullable state`. Adds try/catch around `saveRoutine` so a Firestore/network error surfaces a toast and the modal stays open; adds `if (!editingRoutine) return;` and `if (!deleteConfirm) return;` guards inside the async closures. Verified: type-check ✓ lint ✓ prettier ✓.
  - PR #1729 (`nightly/admin-config-2026-05-28`) — commit `8fb3c73` `fix(pr-1729): use German typographic quotes („…") in PLG confirm dialogs`. Replaces straight `"` with `„` / `"` in `confirmLeave`, `confirmDelete`, `confirmRemoveMember` to match the existing `sidebar.classes.confirmDelete` style. Verified: i18n tests ✓ (11/11).
  - PR #1730 (`nightly/build-tooling-2026-05-28`) — commit `e7b5c49` `fix(pr-1730): sanitizePrompt single-pass regex + lookup map`. Collapses the 8 chained `.replace()` calls into a single-pass `/[&<>{}[\]\`]/g`regex +`ESCAPE_MAP`lookup; functionally identical, inherently safer against re-evaluation of inserted`&`, one allocation instead of eight. Verified: type-check ✓ lint ✓ sanitize tests ✓ (5/5).
  - PR #1731 (`nightly/debugger-log-2026-05-28`) — commit `ee249f6` `fix(pr-1731): use full path components/widgets/Stations/nexus.ts in run log`. Updates the run-3 Widgets row to use the full repo-root path, matching the convention of other rows. Verified: prettier ✓.
  - PR #1732 (`claude/loving-bell-M4E0T`) — commit `63deb8e` `fix(pr-1732): validate fontFamily union + guard color picker against invalid hex`. Validates `raw.fontFamily` against the `GlobalFontFamily` union in `utils/adminBuildingConfig.ts` (was accepting any non-empty string); adds `isValidHex` helper to `NumberLineConfigurationPanel.tsx` so both color pickers no longer flicker to `#000000` when the adjacent text field has a partial/invalid hex. Added 19th test asserting unknown `fontFamily` strings are rejected. Verified: type-check ✓ lint ✓ prettier ✓ tests ✓ (19/19).
- Reviews posted: 13 (all open PRs received a structured review comment).
- Notes:
  - Branch safety: all 6 fixes were pushed to head branches of PRs targeting `dev-paul`. No push to `main` or `dev-paul`.
  - PR #1720 (`fix-quiz-data-loss`) had 6 review threads — all already resolved by the author in commits 2fbbdc9 / 615db37 / bbee53a before this run started; no automated fix needed.
  - PR #1727 (AnnotationCanvas) had 2 review comments suggesting a `hasPointerCapture` guard fallback and corresponding test mocks. Declined — the PR description explicitly evaluated and rejected this as a band-aid. Every browser this app supports (Chrome 90+, Edge 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+) implements pointer capture, so the guarded code path would never fire.
  - PR #1729 had a defensive `?? {}` test-guard suggestion — declined as a style preference; the current `toHaveProperty` matcher already produces a clear failure if the namespace is missing.
  - PR #1732 had a suggestion to swap the color inputs for `SurfaceColorSettings`. Declined — the panel intentionally uses a uniform plain-input visual style across font dropdown, opacity slider, number/select inputs, and color fields. A partial swap would create visual discontinuity; a whole-panel migration to shared appearance components is a separate scope.

- Fixes pushed: 3
  - PR #1713 (`nightly/admin-config-2026-05-27`) — commit `de87e4e` `fix(pr-1713): remove unnecessary LocaleFile type assertions`. Dropped the `LocaleFile` alias and double `as unknown as` casts; TypeScript infers `.common` on JSON imports. Verified: type-check ✓ lint ✓ tests ✓ (4/4).
  - PR #1712 (`nightly/build-tooling-2026-05-27`) — commit `8cf7332` `fix(pr-1712): handle leading prose with brackets before JSON object`. Added the gemini-suggested test case which exposed a real bug (stray `[` in leading prose like `[docs]` caused `parseGeminiJson` to try parsing `[docs]` as a JSON array). Updated the implementation to retry the brace path if the array-slice parse fails. Verified: type-check ✓ lint ✓ tests ✓ (15/15).
  - PR #1708 (`nightly/unify-toast-arch-2026-05-27-clean`) — commit `d37b011` `fix(pr-1708): functional setSymbols update + async handleSave`. `setSymbols` now accepts both array and functional-updater forms; `handleFiles` uses functional update and no longer depends on `globalConfig.symbols`; `handleSave` is async, prop signature accepts `void | Promise<void>`. Verified: type-check ✓ lint ✓.
- Reviews posted: 14 (all open PRs received a structured review comment).
- Notes:
  - Branch safety: pushed to nightly/admin-config-2026-05-27, nightly/build-tooling-2026-05-27, nightly/unify-toast-arch-2026-05-27-clean (all fair game). No push to `main` or `dev-paul`. PR #1702 (`dev-paul → main`) received review comment only — its two open threads already have author-replies pointing at #1703 fixes.
  - Cross-cutting bleed-through observation: PRs #1704, #1706, #1707, #1709 all carry the WorkSymbolsConfigurationModal.tsx diff from a shared base with #1708, which is why gemini-code-assist left the same race/async findings on each. Replied on each PR explaining the canonical fix lives in #1708 (commit d37b011) and no per-PR push is needed.
  - Declined refactor: the URL-API rewrite suggestion on #1711 was scoped much larger than the targeted YouTube playlist regression — would touch all 36 existing tests. Recommended a separate follow-up PR.
  - Declined wrapper on #1716: gemini suggested wrapping `updateConfig` to narrow the type. The reference pattern in `NeedDoPutThen/Settings.tsx` (whose config also lacks `scaleMultiplier`) passes a direct callback under strict type-check, and the `writeScaleMultiplier={false}` default prevents `scaleMultiplier` from ever being dispatched at runtime. Not changing the established pattern.

PR #1685's 18 review threads are all resolved — no action.
- Fixes pushed: 2
  - PR #1694 (`claude/loving-bell-LrmHy`) — commit `fa204a53` `fix(pr-1694): rephrase 'sole exception' wording in new-widget skill reference table`. Rephrased to "exception to the standard `Widget.tsx` convention" after verifying TimeToolWidget, ClassesWidget, BreathingWidget, ScheduleWidget, PdfWidget, RandomWidget, StickerBookWidget, and Catalyst widgets all deviate from the convention. Verified: `pnpm exec prettier --write` re-formatted table column widths.
  - dev-paul reviewer concerns (PR #1690 + #1691) — addressed via new PR **#1695** (`claude/pr-review-fixes-2026-05-26`) commit `b47ddeca` `fix(pr-1690,1691): harden QR DOMParser body access + admin clock format24 type check`. Two-line patch: `doc.body?.textContent` in `QRWidget/deriveSyncedUrl.ts:16` and `typeof raw.format24 === 'boolean'` in `utils/adminBuildingConfig.ts:141`. Verified: `pnpm type-check` ✓, `pnpm lint --max-warnings 0` ✓, `pnpm run format:check` ✓, 31 tests passed. Opened as a separate PR because direct pushes to `dev-paul` returned HTTP 403 from the automation proxy.
- Reviews posted: 6
  - PR #1685: Ready with minor notes — massive Phase 2 work, all 18 prior threads resolved, only known follow-up is the cross-user synced-drawing gap documented as TODO.
  - PR #1690: Ready with minor notes — rollup of #1684/#1687/#1688/#1689, two hardening fixes pulled into #1695, the `prefer-promise-reject-errors` disables preserve realistic Firestore rejection shapes in mock.
  - PR #1691: Ready with minor notes — single mechanical theme-color substitution; rebase on current dev-paul HEAD will collapse the apparent unrelated-changes diff.
  - PR #1692: Ready with minor notes — doc-only canon doc; same rebase-collapses-diff caveat as #1691.
  - PR #1693: Ready — standard Tuesday audit cadence; surfaced the new `qs` MEDIUM as worth tracking in the next functions/ dep sweep.
  - PR #1694: Ready — small but useful 404-link fix in the new-widget skill table.
- Notes:
  - Branch safety: pushed to `claude/loving-bell-LrmHy` (fair game) and new branch `claude/pr-review-fixes-2026-05-26` (fair game). Attempted direct push to `dev-paul` for #1690 hardening fixes; the proxy returned HTTP 403, so the fixes were rerouted through new PR #1695 against dev-paul. No pushes to `main` or `dev-paul` direct.
  - The "scope mismatch" comments on #1691 and #1692 turned out to be artifacts of both branches being created off an older dev-paul SHA — the PR diff appears to include #1684/#1687/#1688/#1689 file deltas because git renders them against the branch's older base. Rebasing on current dev-paul HEAD before merge will collapse each PR to its actual single-purpose change.
  - The `react-hooks/refs` rule the reviewers kept citing is not actually enabled in `eslint.config.js` (only `react-hooks/recommended` is). Verified by running `pnpm lint --max-warnings 0` clean on the current dev-paul HEAD with the DriveFileAttachment render-body ref pattern in place. The local disable in `hooks/useDebouncedCallback.ts` appears to be defensive rather than required.

- Reviews posted: 4
  - PR #1687 TimeTool RAF perf fix: Ready — root-cause fix splits the conflated tick + auto-trigger into two effects with the correct dep array for each concern; new regression tests cover both the perf bug and the closure-via-effect freshness invariant.
  - PR #1686 useEffect audit doc: Ready — doc-only, 9a2302d fixup commit reconciled the headline numbers (527 graded of 567 total) and corrected the DriveFileAttachment/DashboardView/BoardNavFab/MusicManager entries. Suggested nice-to-have: permalink the actionable D/C entries at audit-base SHA `8765c4f` for line-drift resilience.
  - PR #1685 Whiteboard Phase 2: Needs description update + Wave 8 + test-plan checkboxes — PR description still says "Wave 1 in progress / Waves 2-8 pending" but waves 1-7 have landed on this branch as separate per-wave commits; only Wave 8 (Firestore subcollection) remains. Branch also drags in the unmerged dev-paul backlog because it's based off main — confirm merge plan.
  - PR #1684 MiniApp toolbar + Clock building defaults: Ready with minor notes — both items well-scoped, all self-review feedback addressed (rounding + zero-guard in 8bf7759/ed08dbc, partial-validity tests, `Completed-pending-merge` journal convention). Manual visual-regression checkboxes in test plan still unticked.
- Notes:
  - Branch safety: 1 push to `claude/dev-paul-bug-perf-fix-1xnnH` (fair game per safety rule). No pushes to `main` or `dev-paul`.
  - The five `gemini-code-assist` comments on PR #1687 were all valid — `updateWidget` already shallow-merges via `context/DashboardContext.tsx:4470`, so the `...widget.config` spread was redundant and risked write-skew with the stale `activeDashboard` closure when timer-end triggers fire.

- Comments processed: 11 unresolved review threads across the four PRs — 0 fixed (none actionable), 11 already addressed/explained. PR #1672's five threads (Copilot `console.error`→`logError` + ungated poll; Gemini ×2 missing `isDefault: false`; Copilot stale-title) each already carry an author reply, with the three code fixes staged on #1674. PR #1366's six threads are all outdated/resolved across prior sweeps. PR #1674 and #1675 had no inline review comments.
- Fixes pushed: 0
  - No new code fixes were needed. The actionable #1672 feedback is already implemented on #1674 (verified the diff: explicit `isDefault: false` after `sanitizeBoardSnapshot`, `logError('DashboardContext.duplicateDashboard', …)`, and the quiz `useFocusLossPoll` gate `tabWarningsEnabled && session.status === 'active' && myResponse?.status !== 'completed'`). The `dev-paul` push permission was therefore not exercised.
- Reviews posted: 4
  - PR #1675 useActivityWallLibrary tests: Ready — 13 well-structured tests (listener wiring, snapshot mapping + sparse-doc defaults, empty-`classId` strip rule, signed-out throw paths) following the `usePlcNotes.test.ts` pattern; test-only + scheduled-task doc-log refresh, no production risk.
  - PR #1674 #1672 fix-up: Ready with minor notes — three correct, minimal fixes mapping 1:1 to the #1672 bot comments. Flagged merge ordering (must land in `dev-paul` with/before #1672) and a small gap (no test asserting the poll disables once `myResponse.status === 'completed'`).
  - PR #1672 Boards Duplicate + focus-loss: Ready with minor notes — all 14 CI checks green; `useFocusLossPoll` is well-designed and follows the useEffect-escape-hatch rule (latest-callback ref in render body, first-call-only seed surviving snapshot re-renders). Key note: this branch's own diff still carries the pre-fix code, so #1674 + the #1673 changelog must be sequenced into `dev-paul` alongside it.
  - PR #1366 line-endings plan: Ready — doc-only, all reviewer threads resolved; noted the PR has been open since 2026-04-21 and is itself the kind of open PR its execution preconditions require cleared, so it should be merged (inert until executed) or closed.
- Notes:
  - Branch safety: zero pushes to any PR branch this run (no actionable fixes). No push to `main`; `dev-paul` push permission not exercised.
  - #1672, #1674, and #1673 (changelog) form a merge set against `dev-paul` — sequencing them together is the main reviewer-flagged concern, since #1672 in isolation ships the bot feedback unaddressed.

PR #1665's six review threads are all already resolved. PR #1366's remaining `.editorconfig` proposal continues to be deferred (fourth sweep — still pending author decision).
- Fixes pushed: 0
  - PR #1666 gemini comment was a MEDIUM scope-expansion suggestion against an intentionally HIGH-only, single-line `pnpm.overrides` PR. The `flatted`/`ws`/`yaml` items are tracked individually as Open in `docs/scheduled-tasks/dependency-audit.md` and warrant per-override verification on the Tuesday cadence rather than being bundled into a focused production-bundle CVE fix. Replied inline with the scope rationale; no code change pushed.
- Reviews posted: 3
  - PR #1666 lodash-es override: Ready — focused security fix, lockfile change is a single resolution swap, all verification (audit, type-check, lint, format, tests 2809/2809, build) documented in the PR description. Companion audit-doc updates (axios → 1.16.0, tar override → >=7.5.11) are tracked Open items, not blockers.
  - PR #1665 personal-spotify gate: Ready — generalized `buildings?: string[]` field on `GlobalFeaturePermission` is small/additive (existing 15 features unaffected), `FEATURE_DEFAULTS` table centralizes missing-doc default behavior with `personal-spotify` matching the `canSeeShareTracking` precedent (default-off until explicit admin enable). Four new test files (477+ lines) cover the gate matrix, orphan-chip flow, transparent fallback. CI green across all 7 checks. Flagged `context/AuthContext.tsx`'s `canAccessFeature` as the highest-leverage change (called on every gate check) but coverage is good.
  - PR #1366 line-endings plan: Ready with minor notes — no new edits this sweep; all reviewer threads resolved across the prior four sweeps; only `.editorconfig` proposal continues deferred. Observation flagged: the PR is the canonical example of why execution is hard — 12+ revisions over 4 weeks because the renormalize-window precondition keeps reopening as new PRs land. Merging the docs is safe now; executing the plan still requires the quiet window.
- Notes:
  - Branch safety: zero pushes this run (no actionable code fixes needed). All three open PRs had either no actionable comments or pre-existing author replies. The `dev-paul` push permission was not exercised.
  - PR #1665 is the only ready-for-review (non-draft) PR open against `dev-paul` this sweep. CI is green. Author has already swept all six review threads in prior commits.
  - PR #1666 marks `scheduled-tasks` (the daily-audit / scripted-housekeeping branch) → `dev-paul`. Targeting `dev-paul` rather than `main` keeps the auto-deploy preview pipeline opt-in; expected behavior per the dev-\* deploy convention.
  - PR #1366's deferred `.editorconfig` proposal has now been carried forward across four sweeps. Worth a sentence in a future status nudge: either bundle it into PR 1 when the plan is finally executed, or close it explicitly. Not pushing without author input.

PR #1655's three inline review threads were already resolved in earlier commits on the branch; PR #1655's three PR-level comments were already replied to in prior sweeps. PR #1366's remaining `.editorconfig` proposal continues to be deferred (third sweep — author decision pending).
- Fixes pushed: 1
  - PR #1657 / `scheduled-tasks` (`19ba1e8`): two-part fix for gemini-code-assist comments on the new `admin_audit_log` rule. (a) `firestore.rules` — changed `allow read, write` to `allow read, create` so audit entries are append-only (admins cannot edit/delete their own trail); expanded the inline comment to document why `create` (not `write`) is intentional so a future audit can't loosen it. (b) Kept `serverTimestamp()` at the call site — the reviewer's suggestion to switch to `Date.now()` + `is int` validation would WEAKEN security for an audit log (a client-supplied epoch is forgeable, server-set timestamps are not), so the consistency argument applies to data the client should own, not tamper-evident records. Added a rule comment documenting this choice. (c) `docs/scheduled-tasks/firestore-rules.md` — corrected line-range reference (`572-582` after the expanded comment grew the block, was `574-578`) and rewrote the 2026-05-18 audit-note bottom matter from "`admin_audit_log` HIGH open item remains unfixed" to "`admin_audit_log` HIGH item resolved in this PR — match block at lines 572-582 with append-only (`create` not `write`) permission." Verified: prettier ✓, lint ✓, type-check ✓ (test:rules requires firebase emulator not available in this env).
- Reviews posted: 3
  - PR #1657 admin_audit_log rule: Ready with minor notes — solid fix; follow-up suggestion to add `tests/rules/admin_audit_log.test.ts` locking in the immutability invariant (~30 lines, non-blocking), and to route the audit-write `catch` through the existing `logError()` utility so the next silent-deny class of bug surfaces faster. Reminder about post-merge `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules`.
  - PR #1655 Collections + Results Protection: Ready with notes — 146 files / ~17K+ additions, all 14 CI checks green, three prior inline review threads (DashboardContext dot-notation, SoundWidget unreachable resume, useResultsTabWarnings race) already validated and fixed earlier on the branch. Substantial new test coverage shipped (rebutting the prior "12 empty test files" claim — verified again, files have real content). Two human-attention items flagged: (1) PR title is better than the original `"Implement custom list toggling and drag-select enhancements"` but worth a final pass for git-log searchability, and (2) `context/DashboardContext.tsx` (+708/-35) + `types.ts` (+293/-1) + LRU mounting cache lifecycle warrant a manual walkthrough — the dot-notation `setDoc({merge:true})` bug fixed earlier in the same PR is the exact class of subtle Firestore-pipeline regression CLAUDE.md flags this file as prone to.
  - PR #1366 line-endings plan: Ready — no new edits this sweep, all reviewer items already addressed across the previous three sweeps. The single deferred item (`.editorconfig` proposal) carried forward; also flagged that the plan now self-handles the "PR 2 may be a no-op if blobs are already LF" case (`git status` probe between `git add --renormalize .` and `git commit`), so the author can probe locally before scheduling the dedicated window and possibly collapse the rollout to PR 1 + cleanup.
- Notes:
  - Branch safety: All fixes pushed only to `scheduled-tasks` (fair game per CRITICAL BRANCH SAFETY RULE). No push to `main`. `dev-paul` not pushed to this run — PR #1655's comments were already addressed by the author in earlier commits and no new fixes were needed, so the dev-paul push-permission did not need to be exercised.
  - Two of the three PRs (#1655 and #1366) had every actionable reviewer comment addressed before this sweep — these reviews are purely fresh-eyes reads. Only PR #1657 needed new code pushed.
  - Gemini-code-assist's `serverTimestamp() → Date.now()` suggestion on PR #1657 was a generic project-convention rule applied incorrectly to a tamper-evidence context. The reply on the inline comment explains the security rationale for keeping `serverTimestamp()` so the same suggestion isn't re-applied in future passes.

- Fixes pushed: 3
  - PR #1633 / `claude/widget-registry-settings-docs` (`fd47ee2b`): correct stickers flip-panel JSDoc + audit-log entry — the prior wording claimed `StickerBookWidget` hides the flip button, but `DraggableWindow.tsx:2688-2710` unconditionally renders the gear icon and `StickerBookWidget` has no flip-suppressing logic. Flipping a stickers widget shows the standard "Standard settings available." fallback on the Settings tab; appearance lives on the Style tab via `StickerBookAppearanceSettings`. Verified: tsc --noEmit ✓, eslint --max-warnings 0 ✓, prettier --check ✓.
  - PR #1632 / `scheduled-tasks`: same stickers JSDoc + audit-log correction applied (the PR carries a verbatim copy of PR #1633's WidgetRegistry.ts block and the same Completed entry). Pushed alongside the pr-review-log update for this run.
  - PR #1366 / `docs/line-endings-normalization-plan` (`a9eaa492`): five doc edits — Step 2 now creates a branch (`chore/normalize-line-endings`) before renormalize commands, adds `git status` sanity check between `--renormalize` and `commit` (so an empty-staging case isn't silently treated as a failure), and includes the `gh pr create` invocation with the title pinned to the Step 4 grep pattern; Step 5 working-tree refresh lifted out of the conflict-resolution block into an unconditional `git rm --cached -r . && git reset --hard` after the rebase loop (a conflict-free rebase never pauses for `--continue` so the prior phrasing left the operator without a refresh signal); Rollback section uses the same subject-grep + hard-fail + verification echo pattern as Step 4 instead of a `<renormalize-commit-hash>` placeholder, and adds a follow-up block to register the revert commit's hash in `.git-blame-ignore-revs` (the revert produces matching blame pollution on the same ~932 files). Verified: prettier --check ✓.
- Reviews posted: 3
  - PR #1633 widget-registry docs: Ready — JSDoc + audit-log both corrected during this pass; CI mostly green with Code Quality job still running; cross-PR consistency note flagged the verbatim duplicate in PR #1632 (which was fixed in parallel).
  - PR #1632 Friday audit: Ready — three daily audits performed, one new LOW item (MiniApp portaled active-app toolbar) detected with sound fix options. Cross-PR overlap with #1633 called out and resolved.
  - PR #1366 line-endings plan: Ready — five operator-failure-mode fixes applied this pass; `.editorconfig` proposal left for author decision.
- Notes:
  - Both gemini-code-assist threads on PR #1633 were inline review comments tied to the WidgetRegistry.ts JSDoc and the audit-log entry. Verified directly against `DraggableWindow.tsx` (gear icon unconditionally rendered) and `WidgetRenderer.tsx:169-173` (the "Standard settings available." fallback) — the JSDoc claim that StickerBookWidget hides the flip button was factually wrong. The audit-log entry was authored in the same PR (not a historical log), so correcting it from inception keeps the resolution accurate.
  - Coordination call-outs raised in reviews:
    - PR #1633 + #1632 — same JSDoc block duplicated across both PRs; whichever merges first wins, conflict resolution should preserve the corrected wording.
    - PR #1366 — `.editorconfig` would prevent the "Delete ␍" friction from returning on newly-created Windows files but is out of scope for this plan; author should decide whether to bundle into PR 1 or open a separate `feat: add .editorconfig` PR.

- Comments processed: 12 unresolved comment threads across the 4 PRs — 3 fixes prepared & verified locally but blocked by branch protection on `dev-paul` (HTTP 403 push reject) so posted as suggestion diffs, 2 explained as no-fix-needed (architectural API refactor / i18n-cross-cut), 1 deferred as needing a deliberate schema decision, 6 already-addressed-by-author skipped (PR #1621 × 3 outdated/fixed in c733f59, PR #1366 × 6 — author replies on each).
- Fixes pushed: 0 (push to `dev-paul` for PR #1622 blocked by branch protection HTTP 403; prepared diffs posted as `\`\`\`suggestion` blocks for manual apply)
  - PR #1622 prepared diffs (verified locally — type-check ✓, lint ✓, 2458/2458 unit tests pass):
    - `firestore.rules:811`: replace `matches(uid + '_.*')` with `startsWith(uid + '_')` for shared_activity_walls sessionId-ownership check
    - `components/quiz/QuizStudentApp.tsx:2491`: derive icon/border from `writtenGrade` only for written question types (avoid red/X on ungraded responses where `publishAssignmentScores` stored `ans.isCorrect = false`)
    - `components/quiz/QuizStudentApp.tsx:2605`: fall back to sanitized `studentAnswer` when a points-only / comment-only grade has no `gradingSnapshot` (currently shows "— no response")
    - `tests/components/quiz/PublishedScoreReview.annotations.test.tsx`: new regression test `falls back to the live answer when a points-only grade has no snapshot`
- Reviews posted: 4
  - PR #1623 manual group editing: Ready (after the i18n follow-up is scheduled and manual smoke passes); helper extraction + `randomEditHelpers.test.ts` (18 tests) + group-id preservation noted as exactly the right shape; main gap is no DnD integration test (deferred to manual smoke per the PR's test plan)
  - PR #1622 quiz annotations: Needs changes — 3 of the 5 open reviewer threads have prepared fixes; the `firestore.rules:838` schema-lock concern was deferred as needing a deliberate mutable-field allow-list decision rather than an automated patch; declined the `htmlToPlainText` overload as a perf-refactor not a bug
  - PR #1621 substitute teacher portal: Ready with minor notes — every actionable reviewer thread closed by c733f59/613ccb2 in author's prior round (including the composite `(intendedMode, expiresAt)` index for `expireSubShares`); follow-ups for Phase 6 real widget renderer, i18n backfill, and emulator-based rules/function tests are explicitly called out by author
  - PR #1366 line-endings plan: Ready (eighth review on this PR with no content change since `da8f0946`); flagged that PR is ~3 weeks old and the "quiet window" precondition may need an updated execution date
- Notes:
  - Branch-safety: PR #1622's head is `dev-paul`. Per the CRITICAL rule, push to `dev-paul` is permitted "when there are PR comments on a PR merging dev-paul into main" — but the local proxy rejected the push with HTTP 403, indicating infrastructure-level branch protection takes precedence over the conditional permission. The prepared commit was reset and the diffs surfaced as inline suggestions so the maintainer can apply manually.
  - Coordination call-outs raised in reviews:
    - PR #1623 — i18n strings in `RandomGroups.tsx` / `StudentChip.tsx` / `UnassignedTray.tsx` / `ShuffleList.tsx` need a module-wide sweep PR (not a one-off fix)
    - PR #1622 — `shared_activity_walls` update rule should adopt a `keys().hasOnly([...])` schema-lock paired with rules tests for the disallowed-field-injection paths
    - PR #1366 — eight reviews and three weeks in; consider whether the renormalization can actually land in a quiet window given the current open-PR landscape

  - #1366 — docs: plan for repo-wide line-ending normalization (base `main`)
- Comments processed: 21 unresolved comment threads across the 5 PRs — 1 fixed by code change, 1 attempted-but-blocked by branch protection, 11 explained as no-fix-needed (audit-context / a11y-cross-cut / i18n-sweep / test-refactor / architectural), 5 already-addressed-by-author skipped (PR #1600 × 3, PR #1366 × 6 — author replies on each).
- Fixes pushed:
  - `c318bc70` on `claude/charming-ramanujan-AR3BP` (PR #1606) — safely handle undefined `WIDGET_DEFAULTS.nextUp.config` by typing the cast as `NextUpConfig | undefined` and spreading `?? {}`. `pnpm type-check` ✓, `pnpm lint --max-warnings 0` ✓, `tests/utils/adminBuildingConfig.test.ts` 11/11 ✓.
- Reviews posted: 5
  - PR #1606 `getAdminBuildingConfig` extraction: Ready — clean seam extraction (-400 lines from `DashboardContext.tsx`), 11 unit tests added, follow-up note on adding fixtures for the 20+ untested switch cases.
  - PR #1605 Wednesday audit: Ready with minor notes — three doc-consistency points from the gemini reviewer left for human pass; surfaces real `stations` admin-config gap that should land before the next stations-related merge.
  - PR #1602 PLC CTAs + AI fallback: Ready with minor notes — flagged mixed-scope (PR title scoped to PLC, but AI-fallback work also lands), `void _omit;` cleanup blocked by branch protection, `any`-typed Firestore mock + `eslint-disable` blocks in `functions/src/index.test.ts` worth a dedicated cleanup PR.
  - PR #1600 LRU cache: Ready — textbook small refactor, every reviewer edge case (K = undefined, V = undefined) addressed with dedicated tests, 244/244 functions tests passing.
  - PR #1366 Line-endings plan: Ready — doc-only, all 6 prior reviewer comments have author resolutions, execution correctly deferred to a "no other PRs open" window.
- Notes:
  - Branch safety: today's run pushed only to `claude/charming-ramanujan-AR3BP` (matches neither `main` nor `dev-*`). One attempted push to `dev-paul` (PR #1602 `void _omit;` cleanup) was rejected by branch protection with HTTP 403 — local commit reset, comment posted explaining the situation.
  - PR #1606 was already fast-following the HIGH item that #1605's Wednesday audit itself flagged (`DashboardContext.tsx` +937 lines/week). Cross-PR coherence: the audit identified the seam, the extraction PR landed the fix, both reviewed in the same nightly run.
  - PR #1600 and PR #1366 review threads all had prior author replies acknowledging fixes — skipped duplicate "already addressed" replies to avoid noise.
  - One cross-PR finding: PR #1605's `stations` admin-config gap (no `StationsConfigurationPanel`, no `FeatureConfigurationPanel` entry, no `getAdminBuildingConfig` case) is the same gap the `admin-widget-config` skill exists to prevent. Now in `utils/adminBuildingConfig.ts` after PR #1606 — surfacing here so the next stations-related merge picks it up.

- Fixes pushed:
  - `20637623` on `claude/improve-plc-dashboard-Z1HvH` (PR #1582) — clarified `LibraryPreviewPane` docstring to accurately describe unmount-on-close behavior (no exit animation; slide-in classes reused on each open). `pnpm type-check` ✓, `pnpm lint --max-warnings 0` ✓.
- Reviews posted: 5
  - PR #1585 protobufjs pin: Ready — textbook security patch with single-version lockfile evidence and `pnpm test` 2301/2301 + functions test 209/209 verification.
  - PR #1584 Tuesday audit: Ready — markdown-only journal updates; net positive in surfacing the new hono 4.12.15→4.12.18 CVE pair.
  - PR #1582 PLC overhaul: Ready with minor notes — opt-in flag limits blast radius; flagged Firestore-rules emulator gate, `types.ts` +86 line surface, and missing `commitTileCoords` unit-test coverage as merge gates.
  - PR #1580 DraggableWindow listener leak: Ready — pointer-capture-target binding + unmount cleanup ref is the right fix; new regression test (`clears global drag-state body class when host unmounts mid-gesture`) locks in the behavior.
  - PR #1366 Line-endings doc: Ready — doc-only; all 6 prior reviewer comments are already addressed; execution correctly deferred per the plan's own "all open PRs merged or closed" precondition.
- Notes:
  - Branch safety: today's run pushed only to `claude/improve-plc-dashboard-Z1HvH` (matches neither `main` nor `dev-*`). No writes to `main` or `dev-paul`.
  - PR #1580 review threads (5 total) were all already replied to by the author citing commit 7c84765 — skipped duplicate "already addressed" replies to avoid noise.
  - One cross-PR finding: `@ungap/structured-clone@1.3.0` deprecation (CWE-502, fix in 1.3.1) surfaces in the PR #1585 lockfile diff. Gemini-code-assist flagged it; replied that it belongs in the next scheduled-tasks audit cycle rather than this PR's narrow protobufjs scope.

- Fixes pushed:
  - `958c237` on `docs/line-endings-normalization-plan` — applied 3 doc improvements to `docs/line-endings-normalization-plan.md` covering Step 2 PR-title guidance (issue 4374319374), Step 3 verification parenthetical (issue 4374318572), and Step 5 pre-flight `git status` guard (issue 4361544503). `prettier --check` ✓.
- Reviews posted: 5
  - PR #1537 PLC Dashboard: Ready with minor notes — strong firestore rules (split create/update with existing-owner check, `keys().hasOnly` schema lock, `sheetUrl` pinned to parent PLC's `sharedSheetUrl`), `void writePlcAssignmentIndexEntry` keeps Assign action fast. Flagged: no test coverage for `usePlcAssignmentIndex` (parser, ordering, error path) or for the new firestore rules.
  - PR #1536 Board import picker: Ready with minor notes — PII scrub coverage is thorough across all three write paths (seed, mirror, linkage). Role-gated rule splits (host/collaborator/self-join/self-leave) with `originalAuthorName` immutability prevent host-display-name spoofing. Flagged: medium regression risk on `DashboardContext.tsx` (~470 lines added; now 3886 lines total); no test for cancellation-on-detach mirror timer path.
  - PR #1535 Publish quiz scores: Ready — well-tested (234 + 115 lines of new tests cover unpublish, multi-response publish, chunking past `MAX_BATCH_WRITES`, anonymous rejection, missing-response throw); server-authoritative grading prevents client-side correctness fabrication; idempotent re-publish + clean unpublish.
  - PR #1534 Quiz shuffle: Ready — per-attempt seed (`${uid}:attempt-${completedAttempts}`) with `:question-order` domain suffix decorrelates the two shuffles; `if (!myResponse) return <loading />` guard prevents `attempt-0` flash on retakes; `shuffleQuestions` correctly restricted to self-paced sessions. 6 new tests cover variance, stability, multiset preservation, and decorrelation.
  - PR #1366 Line endings doc: Ready — doc-only PR; today's run added 3 hardening edits and confirmed the prior 5 review concerns are already addressed in the current revision. CI in progress on `958c237`.
- Notes:
  - All 4 feature PRs (1534, 1535, 1536, 1537) had CI green at review time.
  - All 4 feature PRs target `dev-paul`, not `main` — author has been merging into `dev-paul` for integration testing before the broader merge-up to `main`.
  - Branch safety: today's run pushed only to `docs/line-endings-normalization-plan` (matches neither `main` nor `dev-*`). No writes to `main` or `dev-paul`.
  - 13 of the 16 unanswered review-comment threads on these PRs were already addressed in current code by the author across earlier commits — the threads remained "open" on GitHub because Copilot/Gemini comments are not auto-resolved when the underlying code changes. Posted "already addressed" replies citing the current line numbers and rationale.

- Reviews posted: 13
- Notes:
  - PR #1293 flagged as BLOCKING — `broadcastLiveLeaderboard` referenced in diff but not implemented in `hooks/useQuizSession.ts` on the head branch; consumers would crash at runtime.
  - PRs #1295 and #1296 are near-duplicates — recommended closing one.
  - PR #1291 is on `dev-paul` (dev-\* branch); per branch-safety policy, comments posted but no pushes.
  - PR #1294 touches `DraggableWindow` and `GlassCard` — visual QA pass recommended across representative widget set before merge.
  - Node modules were not installed locally; no `pnpm validate` runs possible. All fixes were low-risk file deletions or review comments that did not require local verification.

  - PR #1311: Needs changes — large PR (51 files, +4766/-1588) with 3 items to address before merge: (1) verify QuizSession.id semantics change doesn't break consumers, (2) fix DiceWidget Roll button scaling regression, (3) confirm composite Firestore index for allocateJoinCode. Also noted ~1,500 lines of new Quiz Assignment code with no test coverage.
- Notes:
  - PR #1318 head SHA `53d22f4c` — mergeable state clean
  - PR #1311 head SHA `8ead5797` — mergeable state clean; Firestore rules changes are well-secured with proper auth checks and ownership enforcement

  - PR #1326: Needs changes (minor) — 3 items flagged: (1) `AbsentStudentsModal.toggleStudent` still calls `setAbsentStudents` inside a `setLocalAbsentIds` updater (side effect in pure function), (2) `useRosters.setAbsentStudents` does `await updateDoc` with no try/catch after optimistic state update, (3) `RandomWidget` uses `widgets.random.markAbsentTitle` / `markAbsentAria` keys that aren't in `en.json` — inconsistent with sibling `widgets.random.absent.*` namespace

Recommended splitting or rewriting the description. All 13 CI checks green.

  - PR #1371: Ready with minor notes — 160+ file cumulative `dev-paul → main` merge; flagged initial-hydration empty `orgBuildings` window, `test:all` workflow change, absent tests for `DriveImagePicker` race path + new library primitives, and 944-line `QuizLiveMonitor` as follow-up extraction candidate
  - PR #1366: Ready — doc-only runbook, no runtime effect; suggested linking from `docs/DEV_WORKFLOW.md`

  - PR #1393: 0 inline threads
  - PR #1392: 1 inline thread (gemini) — race-condition guard on `VideoActivityStudentApp.handleJoin`; replied as UX/product decision flagged for human review
  - PR #1391: 5 inline threads (copilot) — all requesting a `get`/`list` split on the five session collections' read rules. That's the exact shape PR #1390 shipped and which this PR is backing out because it empirically denied teacher single-doc subscriptions. Replied to each noting the architectural tradeoff is already addressed in the PR description's **Security impact** section and routing the decision to a human.

  - PR #1392: Ready with minor notes — Phase 5A multi-class picker across Quiz/VA/GL with sensible backward-compat rules helper; flagged `pnpm test:rules` still unchecked, `classIds[0] === undefined` edge case in four session hooks, and absence of automated coverage for the new multi-class + period-picker behaviors
  - PR #1391: Ready with minor notes — fixes empirically-observed teacher Start regression from #1390 and actively closes the rules-test gap with an end-to-end lifecycle suite + regression smoke across all five session collections + new CI `rules` job; flagged the deployed-rules diff + post-deploy smoke as still-unchecked

  - PR #1399: 12 inline threads total
    - 9 outdated threads (8 gemini + 1 copilot on `AuthContext.memberLastActiveSyncedKeyRef` + `@/` import) — all already applied in current branch HEAD `c393d6e0` (bucket-level `erroredBuckets`, per-(uid,orgId) throttle key, success-only `stampLastActive`, `@/utils/lastActiveThrottle` import); replied with concrete code references
    - 2 non-outdated copilot threads on `OrganizationPanel.ManualResetLinkModal` lines 885–886 — requested a `useEffect` conversion of the `lastUrl`/`copied` reset. Declined: this is the "adjusting state while rendering" pattern that CLAUDE.md explicitly endorses for resetting state on prop change; both branches are guarded and converge in one extra render pass. Replied with the CLAUDE.md citation and the rationale already inline in the source.
    - 1 non-outdated gemini thread on `UsersView.tsx` amber banner accessibility — deferred to a future design-system PR that unifies the partial-failure banner across MyAssignmentsPage / UsersView / GuidedLearningAIGenerator; replied with the deferral rationale and an immediate contrast note (amber-900 on amber-50 clears 4.5:1; amber-800/90 body text is borderline).

  - PR #1393: 0 inline threads
  - PR #1366: 6 inline threads — all have prior author addressing replies; no further action needed
- Fixes pushed: none
  - No unaddressed comments required a code fix. All actionable gemini/copilot suggestions are already implemented in each PR's current head. The two non-outdated architectural-pattern comments on #1399 are explicit CLAUDE.md-endorsed patterns; declining is the correct response.
- Reviews posted: 5
  - PR #1405: Ready with minor notes — complete cqmin conversion across all five GO layouts including Frayer absolute-pin `top-2 left-2`, Venn `mb-2` headers, KWL content `fontSize`, Cause-Effect arrow SVG `width/height="48"`. Overlaps with PR #1394 (same base) — recommend consolidating.
  - PR #1399: Ready with minor notes — 7-commit hardening bundle with strong test coverage (5 new CF test files + 1 context test + 2 unit tests). Flagged: `getOrgUserActivity` total-failure regression smoke, empty `classIds` token sign-out implication, no component test for `MyAssignmentsPage` partial-banner + retry, no test for the `ManualResetLinkModal` render-time state reset, UsersView amber-800/90 body text borderline WCAG AA.
  - PR #1394: Ready — clean mechanical cqmin conversion; merge-orderings with PR #1405 needs resolution
  - PR #1393: Ready — routine journal bookkeeping; zero runtime impact; `ai-integration.md` finding re: `generateGuidedLearning` rate-limit loss is a valuable follow-up tracked

  - PR #1414: 3 inline threads (1 gemini + 2 copilot) — all replied to: 2 fixed in `07cfae3` (lifted `usePlcs`/`usePlcInvitations` to Sidebar parent), 1 fixed in `693ebf3` (added `enabled?: boolean` option to both hooks); 1 PR-level OPS-PIvers comment about #1422 cross-PR coordination already on file
  - PR #1366: 6 inline threads (all `is_outdated: true`) + 1 OPS-PIvers PR-level comment — all addressed in the current head doc since the 2026-04-21 iteration; previously confirmed across three prior automated runs
- Fixes pushed: none
  - No unaddressed comments required a code fix on any PR. All actionable gemini/copilot suggestions are already implemented in each PR's current head. The three flagged PR-level items on #1422 (a11y, stuck-state, CLAIM_URL_ORIGIN) were rolled into the Phase 2 review as merge-blocking notes since they affect production correctness and touch a `dev-paul → main` integration.
- Reviews posted: 5
  - PR #1429: Ready — 16 well-structured Vitest tests (~547 LoC) closing the `useQuizSessionTeacher` coverage gap (`removeStudent`, reveal/hide, `endQuizSession`, `advanceQuestion` including review-phase gate, startedAt-once, advance-past-end with finalize). Auto-progress effect remains the next gap, documented in `test-coverage.md`.
  - PR #1428: Ready with minor notes — clean dialog safety + type-widening fix; suggested adding a Vitest covering the destructive-variant Enter-suppression + Cancel-autofocus contract so the UX guarantee is regression-protected.
  - PR #1422: Needs changes — 89-file integration of PLCs + NeedDoPutThen widget + quiz hardening + reset-link modal + user-activity throttle. CI green and test discipline strong on most surfaces. Three blockers before merge to main: (1) author-flagged AssignmentArchiveCard `OverflowMenu` missing `aria-label` / `aria-haspopup` / `aria-expanded` / Escape handler (WCAG AA), (2) author-flagged `PlcInviteAcceptance` stuck `wrong-account` state after sign-out → sign-in (`if (load.kind !== 'idle') return;` guard short-circuits before re-fetch), (3) no `tests/rules/plc.test.ts` despite +255-line firestore.rules change for new PLC collections. Also flagged: hardcoded `CLAIM_URL_ORIGIN` in `plcInviteEmails.ts` breaks dev-preview testing; `DashboardContext.tsx` -28 net-line change warrants careful review of `getAdminBuildingConfig`; multi-feature dev-branch PR shape is a process observation worth discussing.
  - PR #1414: Ready with minor notes — clean retirement of `VITE_ENABLE_PLCS` flag plus thoughtful listener consolidation (Sidebar owns single `usePlcs`/`usePlcInvitations` pair; `enabled: isOpen` pauses subscriptions when drawer closed; net 6 → 3 → 0 listener reduction). Two follow-ups: (1) coordinate workflow-level `# DEV-FLAG` cleanup with #1422's flag introduction, (2) add Vitest covering the `enabled: false` gate on both hooks.
  - PR #1366: Ready — fourth automated daily review on this branch with no content change since 2026-04-21; nothing material to add. All six prior threads still addressed. Plan execution still gated on "no open PRs" precondition (5 open today, so not yet eligible).
- Notes:

- Comments processed: 9 total — 4 fixed (PR #1366 doc improvements bundled into one commit), 5 explained
  - PR #1470: 1 outdated inline thread (gemini-code-assist on `ai-integration.md` wording for the `magic-layout` fix description) — reply-explained, no code change (wording suggestion, comment is outdated, the actual implementation when this finding is acted on will be a single-line `functions/src/index.ts` change)
  - PR #1469: 10 inline threads — most outdated and addressed in subsequent commits on the branch (role=menu instead of listbox, focus management on open/close, full keyboard handler, useCallback wrapping of click-outside handler, focus-visible rings on menu items, length-truncation cleanup of itemRefs); 2 still-open threads reply-explained pointing at the addressing lines; 1 (gemini high-priority on music FAB opposite-side placement) declined by author with prior rationale, no further action
  - PR #1468: 2 unresolved inline threads (copilot suggesting `useRef` over `useState` for `prevUid` / `prevSessionId`) — both reply-explained: the `useState`-based "adjusting state while rendering" pattern is React's documented approach (per `CLAUDE.md`) and the synchronous re-render is intentional to avoid one-frame stale-data flashes
  - PR #1366: 4 issue-level comments from prior review rounds (Step 3 grep case-sensitivity, Steps 3/4 ordering, Step 5 missing `git add` / `git rebase --continue`, Step 4 `--ignore-all-space` over-broad) — all 4 fixed in a single commit on the branch
- Fixes pushed:
  - PR #1366 → `docs/line-endings-normalization-plan` branch: commit `da8f094` `docs(pr-1366): apply 4 review fixes to line-endings normalization plan` — Steps 3/4 swapped (verification now precedes squash-hash PR step), `SQUASH_HASH` lookup uses `grep -i` plus an explicit empty-hash hard-fail guard, verify-diff drops `--ignore-all-space` in favor of `--ignore-cr-at-eol` alone, rebase-conflict remediation adds the previously-missing `git add <file>` and `git rebase --continue` calls; format:check clean
- Reviews posted: 4
  - PR #1470: Ready — clean extract-method refactor of duplicated four-layer config merge into `mergeWidgetConfig` helper in `utils/widgetConfigPersistence.ts`; both `addWidget` and `addWidgets` delegate to it; 3 new unit tests cover layer ordering, transient-key stripping, all-undefined inputs; touches `DashboardContext.tsx` (regression-risk file) but layer order is preserved byte-for-byte; manual smoke of add-widget + AI-paste flows still unchecked in PR test plan
  - PR #1469: Ready with minor notes — 209-line new `BoardNavFab.tsx` with strong accessibility (role=menu, aria-labelledby, full keyboard nav, focus management, focus-visible rings), help-FAB stacking refactored from nested ternary to named-variable IIFE, dead board-switcher state/refs/effects removed from `Sidebar.tsx`; missing test coverage for the new component flagged as non-blocking follow-up; deliberate "all FABs on one edge" design choice noted (author already declined the music-FAB-opposite-side alternative)
  - PR #1468: Ready — three pattern-compliance refactors per `CLAUDE.md`: `prevSessionId`/`prevUid` "adjusting state while rendering" replaces `useEffect`-only-resets-refs, `shouldSubscribe` boolean replaces `setTimeout(..., 0)` deferral, `DriveAuthError` marker class enables `instanceof`-first classification with message-matching fallback preserved; backwards-compatible; 1678 tests pass per PR description
  - PR #1366: Ready — doc-only, all 4 earlier issue-level comments now addressed in `da8f094`; plan in better shape than at any prior review (operator-friendly step ordering, hard-fail squash-hash capture, accurate verify-diff, complete rebase remediation); execution still gated on "no open PRs" precondition (4 open today, including this PR)
- Notes:
  - PR #1470 head SHA `ac945ca1` — 7 files (4 audit docs + `DashboardContext.tsx` + `widgetConfigPersistence.ts` + test file); CI status pending at review time per github status API

  - PR #1491: Ready with minor notes — Sunday audit run; the diff against `main` includes the duplicated code changes (`useClickOutside`, `useVideoActivitySession`, `firestore.rules`, four StudentApp `logError` migrations, `config/tools.ts` JSDoc, `LazyChunkErrorBoundary` subtitle) that already exist on `dev-paul` and will resolve to no-op once the branch rebases. PR description claim ("audit-only") will read as inaccurate against the visible diff until that rebase happens. Recommend either rebasing onto current `dev-paul` or updating the description.
  - PR #1485: Ready with minor notes — 113-file / 12,469-line PR delivering Assignment Modes (view-only sharing across Quiz/VA/MiniApp/GuidedLearning), Synced Quizzes for PLC collaboration, bottom-screen FAB clusters, and `LazyChunkErrorBoundary`. All 14 CI checks pass. Strong test coverage added (12+ new test files). Two regression-risk items worth a manual smoke pass: (1) widget config merging integration via `mergeWidgetConfig` in `DashboardContext`, (2) `DraggableWindow` world-bound clamping math with grouped widgets at zoom edges. Test gaps: `BoardNavFab` (216 lines, no test), `useSyncedQuizGroups` (338-line hook, rule-only coverage). Pre-existing `Stations` admin-config alignment gap noted as natural follow-up.
  - PR #1366: Ready — sixth automated daily review on this branch with no content change since the 2026-05-01 `da8f094` commit; nothing material to add. All 6 prior threads still addressed.

  - #1366: 6 threads `is_resolved:false` but `is_outdated:true`, each already carrying an author "Addressed" reply from a prior cycle. No new fix or reply needed (re-replying would be noise).
- Fixes pushed: 0
- Reviews posted: 3
  - PR #1677: Ready — clean dead-code removal; reasoning sound (mathTools/recessGear correctly left as global-config pattern, magic/record/remote keys confirmed unreferenced). Flagged one manual check: verify nothing else imports the deleted `SchemaDrivenConfigurationPanel`; `RemoteGlobalConfig` left as documented unused export.
  - PR #1676: Ready with minor notes — large (~73 files) but coherent old-bento→rail-nav swap with excellent test coverage incl. firestore rules tests. Firestore rules (`plcs/docs`, `plc_resources`) are schema-locked with `keys().hasOnly`, enum + type validation, and admin/member auth gates; prior security comment resolved. Notes: confirm rules tests run green in CI (need Java 21, not run locally), and this is Wave 1 of a multi-wave plan.
  - PR #1366: Ready — doc-only; all prior reviewer feedback addressed, open threads outdated. Execution must wait for a no-open-PR window.
- Notes:
  - Branch-safety: #1676 head `dev-paul-plc-redesign` matches `dev-*` → treated read-only (review comment only, no push). #1677 head `scheduled-tasks` and #1366 head `docs/*` are pushable, but Phase 1 produced no fixes, so no pushes to any PR branch this run.
  - This run's log + summary committed on branch `claude/clever-johnson-GghmZ` (the harness-designated development branch) rather than pushed directly to `scheduled-tasks`, since `scheduled-tasks` is the head of open PR #1677 and pushing to it would alter that PR without authorization.

Execution must wait for a no-open-PR window.
- Notes:
  - Branch-safety: only #1366 is open this run (PR #1677 from the 2026-05-21 entry is no longer open, so `scheduled-tasks` is no longer a PR head). #1366 head `docs/*` is pushable but Phase 1 produced no fixes — no pushes to any PR branch.
  - Log committed and pushed to `scheduled-tasks` directly this run, since it is no longer the head of any open PR.

- Notes:
  - Branch-safety: all 8 head branches are non-`main` / non-`dev-*` → pushable. Only #1911 required a fix push.
  - #1916 head is `scheduled-tasks` (this log's branch). The deps bump + audit journals it carries are scheduled-task artifacts in the same family as this log, so appending today's entry here is in-scope; pushed to `scheduled-tasks` per the POST-TASK workflow.

  - #1986: 6 threads, ALL addressed at HEAD — `nodes.length===0` guard now precedes `preventDefault`; modifier-key bailout present; roving `tabIndex={selected?0:-1}`; handler calls `onChange(tabs[nextIdx].key)` (select-follows-focus, closes the tabIndex/onChange mismatch); test now covers Home/End + modifier no-op + roving-tabindex assertion. All 6 resolved.
  - #1984: 2 threads — (a) `gemini` HIGH NaN clamp `Math.max(0, …)` already applied at both `onMove` (~156) and `onUp` (~234), resolved; (b) `claude` informational note about the onMove behavior change left OPEN for author awareness (discussion, not a change request).
  - #1983: 1 thread — `claude` over-long test comment already trimmed to a single line at HEAD; resolved.
  - #1989, #1987, #1985, #1982: no review comments.
- Fixes pushed: 0 — every actionable review comment was already addressed in the current branch HEAD (branches were updated after the reviews were left). No code change needed.
- Reviews posted: 8 (one structured review per PR)
  - #1991: Ready — qs override clears a DoS advisory; caret convention matches siblings; security-positive, low risk.
  - #1986: Ready — full WAI-ARIA §3.23 tablist keyboard model; all six review threads addressed; comprehensive tests.
  - #1985: Ready — `mode==='fresh'` clears stale `lastPollSessionId`; correct root-cause fix; 3 regression tests.
  - #1984: Ready with minor notes — geometric-mean alignment + NaN clamp at both call sites; suggested a small test for the defensive clamp branch.
  - #1983: Ready — DE/ES/FR rootBoards translations; correct root-cause (not a `defaultValue` band-aid); 11 regression tests.
  - #1982: Ready — doc-only unifier run 17 journal; RandomGroups empty-state correctly deferred to designer sign-off.
  - #1987: Ready — doc-only debugger run 19 journal; entries match the four fix PRs.
  - #1989: Ready — standing nightly-audit branch; only non-doc change is a sound test-file rebase resolution; standing dependency vulns are tracked, not introduced here.
- Notes:
  - Branch-safety: all 8 head branches are non-`main` / non-`dev-*` → pushable; Phase 1 produced zero fixes so no PR-branch pushes were needed.
  - Local verification of `pnpm` checks was not run this cycle (no code changes pushed); CI on Node 24 remains the authoritative gate for each PR.
  - This log appended to `scheduled-tasks` per the POST-TASK workflow (continuous log; prior entry was 2026-06-09).

- Comments processed: 13 total — 1 fixed, 12 explained
  - #2004: 1 gemini thread (use `vi.mocked`) → FIXED. Applied `vi.mocked(useDashboardActions)` but kept `as unknown as DashboardActions` on the value since `mockDashboardActions` is an intentional partial of the 16-member surface (verbatim suggestion would not type-check). Verified type-check ✓ lint ✓ tests ✓; pushed.
  - #2003: 1 gemini thread (robust `includesFunctionsTests`) → EXPLAINED (already addressed): the function already splits by line and skips `#`-commented lines.
  - #2002: 2 gemini threads (React 17+ stopPropagation accuracy, both outdated) → EXPLAINED (already addressed): lines 142 and 233 already carry the corrected statement.
  - #2001: 1 claude thread (condense comment block, outdated) → EXPLAINED (already addressed): already condensed to the two-line note.
  - #1999: 4 threads → 2 EXPLAINED as already addressed (`typeStill` = "Bilder"; FR `typeVideo` dedicated assertion exists), 2 EXPLAINED as declined cosmetic Vitest-style nits (`?.` removal — presence checks already use `toHaveProperty`).
  - #1998: 1 gemini thread (`gap-[1cqmin]` → inline style) → EXPLAINED (already addressed): gap is already in the `style` prop.
  - #1984: 2 open claude threads (use `data-testid` selectors) → EXPLAINED (already addressed): all three tests already select via `[data-testid="group-resize-handle-se"]`.
  - #2000, #1997, #1996: no actionable unresolved threads (#1996 all six resolved).
- Fixes pushed: 1
  - #2004 / `perf-content-actions-migration` — `fix(pr-2004): use vi.mocked for useDashboardActions mock typing`.
- Reviews posted: 10 (one structured review per PR)
  - #2004: Ready with minor notes — clean mount-stable migration; merge base #1996 first.
  - #2003: Ready — CI deploy-gate fix + hermetic YAML test.
  - #2002: Ready with minor notes — accurate log; pre-existing contradiction at line 107 (#1939 row) flagged for a future pass.
  - #2001: Ready — minimal, correct, tested stopPropagation fix.
  - #2000: Ready — denominator dedup mirrors numerator; strong coverage.
  - #1999: Ready — i18n parity fix; declined cosmetic test nits.
  - #1998: Ready — cqmin aspect-ratio fix per container-query standard.
  - #1997: Ready — doc-only unifier run-18 log.
  - #1996: Ready — measured, host-safe context split; base for #2004.
  - #1984: Ready — geometric-mean alignment + NaN guard + non-vacuous tests.
- Notes:
  - Branch-safety: all 10 head branches are non-`main` / non-`dev-*` → pushable. Only #2004 required a fix push.
  - Local verification for the #2004 fix ran on Node 22 (env wants 24): targeted `tsc --noEmit` (0 errors), `eslint --max-warnings 0` (clean), and the TrafficLight test (6/6) all passed; full CI on Node 24 remains the authoritative gate.
  - Most nightly PRs had already incorporated reviewer suggestions in later commits before this run, so most threads were explanatory rather than fixes.

- Comments processed: 17 total — 2 fixed, 9 explained, 6 skipped (already answered by author / outdated nitpicks)
  - #2016: 2 gemini threads (migrateProportionalLayout `Math.abs` on wProp/hProp) → EXPLAINED (already addressed): current code uses strict `wProp <= 0 || wProp > 1.5` (lines 42-45) and `wProp > 0 && wProp <= 1.5` (lines 109-112).
  - #2014: 2 gemini threads (body.style.overflow restore) → FIXED: replaced dummy getter/setter restore with `delete` of the shadowed instance property in both `afterEach` and the in-test restore.
  - #2011: 2 gemini ref-reset threads → EXPLAINED (already addressed): render-body resets `if (isEditing) isCancellingRef.current = false;` / `if (editing) cancellingRef.current = false;` already present. 4 further threads (eslint-disable back-and-forth answered by author; 2 outdated claude test-quality nitpicks) → SKIPPED.
  - #2010: 1 gemini TS-narrowing thread → EXPLAINED (already addressed): code already uses `priorData && typeof priorData.contextTitle === 'string'`.
  - #2009: 2 gemini threads (defensive null/Array guards + tests) → EXPLAINED (declined): out of scope for the dedup fence; `if (!q || !q.id) continue` would change semantics for id-less questions.
  - #2007: 3 threads (gl.switchSlide10/addStep commit-count drop) → EXPLAINED (resolved in follow-up): counts restored to 10 / 3, the 10→1 / 3→1 was a full-suite isolation artifact.
  - #2013, #2012, #2006: no unresolved threads.
- Fixes pushed: 1
  - #2014 / `nightly/layout-2026-06-18` — `fix(pr-2014): restore native body.style.overflow via delete in Modal test cleanup`.
- Reviews posted: 9 (one structured review per PR)
  - #2016: Ready with minor notes — clean PollWidget `clamp()` cap; net diff vs dev-paul is 29 files / +2560 (scheduled-tasks divergence) — confirm intended scope.
  - #2014: Ready — Modal onClose-ref flicker fix + regression test; follow-up test-hygiene fix pushed.
  - #2013: Ready — doc-only debugger run-21 log.
  - #2012: Ready — i18n DE Countdown fix, well-justified and tested.
  - #2011: Ready — pattern-consistent Escape-cancel guards with regression tests.
  - #2010: Ready — LTI contextTitle null-clobber fix; transaction-safe, tested.
  - #2009: Ready — quizMaxPoints dedup fence mirrors push-path seenIds; tested.
  - #2007: Ready — deterministic commit counts intact; only indicative timings moved.
  - #2006: Ready — doc-only unifier run-19 log.
- Notes:
  - Branch-safety: all 9 head branches are non-`main` / non-`dev-*` → pushable. Only #2014 required a fix push.
  - Local verification for the #2014 fix ran on Node 22 (env wants 24): `tsc --noEmit` (0 errors), `eslint --max-warnings 0` (clean), and `vitest` Modal suite (16/16) all passed; full CI on Node 24 remains the authoritative gate.
  - #2016 scope: the `scheduled-tasks` head has diverged ~29 files from `dev-paul`, so its PR diff far exceeds the stated one-line PollWidget change — flagged in the review for human confirmation.

## 2026-07-02

- PRs reviewed: 9
  - #2127 — docs(unifier): run 23 dedupe of `unifier.md` (head `nightly/unifier-log-2026-07-02`, base `dev-paul`)
  - #2126 — chore(imports): relative → `@/` alias in 14 test files (head `nightly/unify-import-paths-2026-07-02`, base `dev-paul`)
  - #2125 — fix(stickers): guard floating-menu actions on locked/read-only boards (head `claude/serene-meitner-7luik8`, base `dev-paul`)
  - #2124 — docs(unifier): run 23 all-aligned log (head `nightly/unifier-log-2026-07-01`, base `dev-paul`)
  - #2120 — fix(deps): bump dompurify to 3.4.11 / GHSA-cmwh-pvxp-8882 (head `deps/dompurify-3.4.11`, base `dev-paul`)
  - #2119 — audit(tuesday): scheduled audit journals + useScreenRecord tests (head `scheduled-tasks`, base `dev-paul`)

  - #2101 — fix(dashboard): Escape-minimize + screen-record listener churn (head `nightly/dashboard-2026-06-28`, base `dev-paul`)
  - #2098 — NumberLine Escape-cancel/a11y + AI feature label sync (head `dev-paul`, base `main`)
- Comments processed: 1 new unresolved — 0 fixed, 1 explained. Every other open review thread across the 9 PRs already carried an author reply (addressed in earlier commits/PRs #2099/#2123/#2125) and needed no new action.
  - #2119: new gemini/claude thread (discussion_r3510696315) requesting a `startRecording` concurrent-call guard + test → EXPLAINED (no fix). Scope: production hook change belongs in the dedicated `useScreenRecord.ts` follow-up already tracked on this PR (with the unmount-cleanup/`mountedRef` guard), not this audit-journal PR. Also flagged the suggested one-liner `if (isRecording) return;` as unsafe — `startRecording`'s deps are `[options, stopRecording]`, so a ref-based guard (`mediaRecorderRef.current?.state === 'recording'`) is the correct fix.
- Fixes pushed: 0 (no PR carried an unaddressed comment with an unambiguous, in-scope mechanical fix).
- Reviews posted: 9 (one structured review per PR)
  - #2127: Ready — docs-only `unifier.md` dedup (633→491 lines); good double-merge prevention note.
  - #2126: Ready — pure relative→`@/` test-path sweep; all 20 call-sites verified equivalent, test counts unchanged.
  - #2125: Ready — sticker lock/read-only guards; closes a real `bringToFront` read-only write path; 9/9 tests.
  - #2124: Ready — docs-only run-23 log; flagged 3 concurrent "run 23" `unifier.md` PRs risk re-duplication.
  - #2120: Ready — dompurify security bump; override correctly collapses transitive monaco pin to single 3.4.11.
  - #2119: Ready — audit journals + useScreenRecord test suite; 3 documented hook gaps deferred to a dedicated follow-up.
  - #2118: Ready — docs-only run-23 log + prettier/dedupe maintenance; same three-PR overlap caveat.
  - #2101: Ready — two dashboard bug fixes with root-cause writeups + regression tests.
  - #2098: Ready with minor notes — dev-paul→main integration PR, 14/14 CI green, all 8 threads addressed; a few stale-closure/read-only items deferred by design.
- Notes:
  - Branch-safety: only #2098 is a `dev-*`→`main` PR (read-only for fixes); the rest target `dev-paul` from pushable feature branches. No fix pushes were needed this run, so nothing was pushed to any PR branch.
  - CI health: #2098 shows all 14 checks green; no failing checks observed on any open PR.
  - Housekeeping: three separate "run 23" `unifier.md` PRs (#2118, #2124, #2127) are open at once — flagged in each review that they must merge in a deliberate order (ideally consolidated) to avoid re-introducing the exact log duplication #2127 is cleaning up.

## 2026-07-03

- PRs reviewed: 3
  - #2125 — fix(stickers): guard floating-menu Delete on locked/read-only boards (head `claude/serene-meitner-7luik8`, base `dev-paul`)
  - #2119 — audit(tuesday): scheduled audit journals + SegmentedControl unification (head `scheduled-tasks`, base `dev-paul`)
  - #2098 — NumberLine Escape-cancel/a11y + AI feature label sync (head `dev-paul`, base `main`)
- Comments processed: 3 new unresolved threads — 0 fixed, 3 explained. Every other open review thread across the 3 PRs already carried an author reply from an earlier run and needed no new action.
  - #2125 (discussion_r3517394360): outdated single-slot `cleanupRef` fragility note → EXPLAINED. Superseded by the `Set<() => void>` gesture-cleanup refactor in `b981cc7`; no further change.
  - #2119 (discussion_r3517687333): `SegmentedControl` `role="tab"`→`role="radio"` a11y swap → EXPLAINED (no fix). The suggested swap is incomplete — ARIA `role="radio"` on `<button>`s still needs a custom roving-tabindex + arrow-key handler (native arrow-nav only applies to real `<input type="radio">`), and the container needs `role="radiogroup"`. A correct fix is a focused a11y follow-up, out of scope for an audit-journal PR.
  - #2119 (discussion_r3517687898): `SpecialistScheduleWidget.handleStartTimer` pre-existing bugs (unclamped `newXProp` off-screen spawn; `20/safeCurW` vs `20/safeRefW` gap denominator) → EXPLAINED (no fix). Off-screen recovery is a UX tradeoff (flush-right-overlap vs place-left), not a one-liner; the denominator is an arguable proportional-coord consistency call. Tracked for a dedicated `SpecialistScheduleWidget` placement fix + regression test.
- Fixes pushed: 0 (no PR carried an unaddressed comment with an unambiguous, in-scope mechanical fix).
- Reviews posted: 3 (one structured review per PR)
  - #2125: Ready — sticker lock/read-only guards; closes several unguarded z-order/delete/clear-board write paths on locked boards; ~19 regression tests; all 18 threads dispositioned.
  - #2119: Ready — audit journals + `Segmented`→shared `SegmentedControl` extraction (re-exported to preserve import paths) + valid SpecialistSchedule Tailwind fix (arbitrary `border-[min(6px,1.5cqmin)]` class → inline `borderWidth` style). Two adjacent findings deferred.
  - #2098: Ready with minor notes — dev-paul→main integration PR aggregating fixes routed via #2099/#2123/#2125/#2128; all 12 threads dispositioned; deferred read-only-viewer close + matching-quiz builder validation are non-blocking follow-ups.
- Notes:
  - Branch-safety: only #2098 is a `dev-*`→`main` PR (read-only for fixes; dev-paul push exception unused this run since all comments were already addressed via routed sub-PRs). #2125 and #2119 target `dev-paul` from pushable branches. No fix pushes were needed, so nothing was pushed to any PR branch.
  - CI: both #2098 and #2125 report no legacy commit statuses (repo uses GitHub Actions checks); merge-readiness noted as pending Actions green.

  - #2098 — NumberLine Escape-cancel/a11y + AI feature label sync (head `dev-paul`, base `main`)
  - Not separately reviewed: #2134 (engaged via a fix push), #2131 (all threads already resolved/declined), #2132 (mechanical import-path swaps), #2133 (docs-only unifier log) — all low-risk and already carrying automated reviews.
- Comments processed: 14 unresolved threads acted on across 4 PRs — 4 fixed (2 pushes), 10 explained + resolved (already addressed by follow-up commits on their branches). #2098 (12 threads) and #2131 (5 threads) already had author replies on every thread; no new action.
  - #2139: 3 gemini threads → FIXED in 21f08db, replied + resolved.
  - #2134: 1 claude thread → FIXED in 7354f7b, replied + resolved.
  - #2136: 6 claude threads → EXPLAINED + resolved (all addressed by follow-up commits 666fda6/f2b7f21: `shouldShowFolder` guard, `reorderPreservingHidden`, `visibleItems`-based FolderPlus).
  - #2135: 4 threads → EXPLAINED + resolved (dedup now keys on shared `normalizeAnswer`; comment blocks trimmed per CLAUDE.md).
- Fixes pushed: 2
  - #2139 / `nightly/build-tooling-2026-07-04` / 21f08db — adopt native `import.meta.dirname`/`filename` (drop `node:url`), guard missing baseline entry, normalize `isMain` path comparison. Verified: 9/9 script tests, format, functional run.
  - #2134 / `scheduled-tasks` / 7354f7b — trim `GLOBAL_FONT_FAMILY_OPTIONS` block comment to one line (CLAUDE.md one-line rule). Verified: type-check, lint, format clean.
- Reviews posted: 6 (one structured review per reviewed PR)
  - #2139: Ready — real, empirically-reproduced CI gap closed; additive tooling, gitignored artifacts, 9-test coverage.
  - #2138: Ready with minor notes — solid i18n fix (feature was English-only in every language); flagged the ~50-line test-file header comment vs the CLAUDE.md one-line rule.
  - #2137: Ready with minor notes — correct Ordering partial-credit fix; flagged the new 11-line comment block vs the one-line rule.
  - #2136: Ready with minor notes — dock permission gating complete; flagged that the two extracted `folderPermissions.ts` helpers have no dedicated unit test (`reorderPreservingHidden` in particular).
  - #2135: Ready — duplicate-term warning root-caused at entry; dedup shares `normalizeAnswer` with grading.
  - #2098: Ready — dev-paul→main integration PR, all 15 checks green, all 12 threads dispositioned; deferred read-only-close follow-up is non-blocking.
- Notes:
  - Cross-PR pattern: three nightly PRs this run (#2137, #2138, and the pre-fix #2135/#2134) introduced multi-paragraph comment blocks that violate the CLAUDE.md "one short line max" rule. #2135/#2134 were corrected; #2137/#2138 flagged in review. Worth a lint rule if it keeps recurring.
  - Branch-safety: only #2098 targets `main` (from `dev-paul`) — no push made there. All fix pushes went to pushable branches (`nightly/build-tooling-2026-07-04`, `scheduled-tasks`). `main` never touched.
  - CI health: all checks green on every PR inspected (#2098 15/15, #2137 7/7); no failing checks observed. New CI runs will trigger on the two fix pushes.

  - #2146 / `scheduled-tasks` / 7b4782f — reset add-jump form, clear stale add-form state on building switch, trim marker/jump labels. Verified: full type-check, lint, 47/47 tests.
- Reviews posted: 9 (one structured review per PR)
  - #2150: Ready with minor notes — security-positive expiry gate; flagged composite-index deploy ordering + legacy-doc audit.
  - #2149: Ready — clean terminology fix with durable regression guard.
  - #2148: Ready — correct nullish-coalescing-over-meaningful-null fix, matches sibling `BoardNavFab`.
  - #2147: Ready — root-cause clamp at persistence layer + UI disable; noted PR body undersells the diff (adds UI guard too).
  - #2146: Ready with minor notes — well-validated admin-config addition; bundles audit journal + feature code.
  - #2145: Ready — docs-only unifier log with self-verified line-count check.
  - #2144: Ready with minor notes — clean label consolidation; flagged semantic `<label>` scope + label spacing for visual review.
  - #2142: Ready — trivial correct import-path convention fix; recommended `no-restricted-imports` follow-up.
  - #2141: Ready with minor notes — integration PR to `main`; crash guards resolved, one open normalization thread flagged for human sign-off.
- Notes:
  - Branch-safety: #2141 targets `main` (from `dev-paul`) — no push made there; its one open thread was explained, not fixed. All 3 fix pushes went to pushable branches (`nightly/admin-config-*`, `nightly/dashboard-layout-*`, `scheduled-tasks`). `main` never touched.
  - Force-push detection: #2148 was force-pushed between review and this run (c31cce7→cc0d025), which already resolved the `MockBoard`→`Dashboard` comment; verified against the branch head rather than the stale review diff.
  - CI health: not separately polled this run; the 3 fix pushes will trigger fresh PR-validation runs on their branches.

  - #2141 Refactor admin modals to SettingsLabel + a11y (dev-paul → main)
- Comments processed: 2 genuinely-unaddressed reviewer threads (both #2146) — 0 fixed, 2 explained. Both flagged a NumberLine marker-color-counter bug that a later commit already fixed (`useState(markers.length)` at Settings.tsx:51 and NumberLineConfigurationPanel.tsx:138); replied on each and noted them outdated. Every other review thread across all 13 PRs already carried an author reply (fixed/deferred/explained) or was marked resolved — no new action required.
- Fixes pushed: 0 — no actionable unaddressed review comment required a code change this run.
- Reviews posted: 13 (one structured review per open PR)
  - #2153 Ready; #2152 Ready; #2142 Ready — clean mechanical refactors.
  - #2147 Ready; #2148 Ready; #2149 Ready — well-tested root-cause fixes.
  - #2150 Ready with minor notes — security-positive expiry gate + regex-spoof hardening; flagged legacy-`expiresAt` doc audit/backfill before the rules deploy.
  - #2146 Ready with minor notes — NumberLine markers/jumps admin building-defaults; the two marker-color-counter threads already resolved in a later commit.
  - #2144 Ready with minor notes — SettingsLabel unification; orphaned-`<label>` a11y + mb-1→mb-2 spacing + scope-extension deferred to a human.
  - #2145 / #2151 / #2154 Ready — docs-only routine logs; flagged the two open run-26 unifier-log PRs (#2145 dated 07-05, #2154 dated 07-06) to avoid overlapping appends.
  - #2141 Ready with minor notes — dev-paul→main rollup; folder-permission crash guards + dup-term logic resolved and tested, two deferred items (grader normalization mismatch, orphaned-label semantics) to decide before merge; CI pending at review time.
- Notes:
  - Branch-safety: no push to `main` or any `dev-*` branch. #2141 (head `dev-paul` → `main`) received a review comment only. The two #2146 comment replies posted via the API; this log commit is the only push, to `scheduled-tasks`.
  - Phase-1 outcome contrast: unlike the prior (07-05) run's 3 fix pushes, every actionable comment this run was already resolved (author replies or later commits), so nothing needed fixing — only two outdated no-reply threads needed a closing reply.

  - #2141 Refactor admin modals to SettingsLabel + a11y (dev-paul → main)
- Comments processed: 11 unresolved threads acted on — 5 fixed, 6 explained/deferred. (Every other thread across the 9 PRs already carried an author reply or was resolved.)
  - Fixed (5): #2162 ×1 (case-insensitive PLC guard regex); #2159 ×2 (void playCleanUpUnlocked so confetti isn't blocked on ctx.resume); #2158 ×2 (generic email fixture + LEAK-test rationale comment).
  - Explained/deferred (6): #2161 ×3 — verified `lastResult`/`jigsawHomeGroups`/`jigsawExpertGroups` are real PII with RandomConfig-unique names (collateral-safe to add) but deferred the add to the maintainer because scrubbing `lastResult` changes reload persistence for the cross-widget Scoreboard/Stations integrations (privacy-vs-persistence product call); #2157 ×1 and #2155 ×1 — outdated threads already resolved on branch head; #2141 ×1 — validated the Dock `SortableContext.items` dnd-kit index bug but did not push (head `dev-paul` = read-only).
- Fixes pushed: 3
  - #2162 → nightly/admin-config-2026-07-07 — case-insensitive `/\bPLCs?\b/i` in the DE plcDashboard terminology guard (test 51/51, lint, format).
  - #2159 → nightly/widgets-2026-07-07 — CatalystWidget + StarterPack/Widget handleExecute made synchronous with `void playCleanUpUnlocked()` (type-check, lint, format, audioUtils 2/2).
  - #2158 → nightly/build-tooling-2026-07-07 — announcementsQuery.test.ts: generic `teacher@` fixture + LEAK-test rationale comment (rules suite 4/4 under the emulator, lint, format).
- Reviews posted: 9 (one structured review per open PR)
  - #2158 / #2159 / #2160 / #2162 / #2155 / #2157 / #2156 Ready.
  - #2161 Ready with notes — shipped fields sound; outstanding `lastResult`/`jigsaw*` PII-scope decision flagged before it fully closes the leak.
  - #2141 Needs changes — strong a11y/consistency refactor, but the Dock `SortableContext.items` filtering bug (hidden folder/gated tool ids left in the items array with no rendered node → dnd-kit index skew) should be fixed + tested before merge to main.
- Notes:
  - Branch-safety: no push to `main` or any `dev-*` branch. #2141 (head `dev-paul` → `main`) received review comments only. All fixes went to `nightly/*` branches; this log commit is the only push to `scheduled-tasks`.
  - #2158 fixes were verified against the real Firestore emulator (`firebase emulators:exec --only firestore`), 4/4 announcements-rules tests green.

  - #2141 — Refactor admin modals to SettingsLabel + a11y (head `dev-paul`, base `main`) — dev-paul→main promotion (push only via the sanctioned review-comment-fix path)
- Comments processed: 4 genuinely-unanswered threads actioned — 1 fixed, 3 explained. Every other unresolved thread across the 13 PRs already carried a reply from the prior (2026-07-07) run or was resolved-in-code, so no re-reply.
  - Fixed (1): #2141 — `MatchingAnswerEditor` used a static `duplicate-term-warning` DOM id (+ its `aria-describedby`), which collides if two editors mount at once → replaced with `React.useId()`.
  - Explained (3): #2141 ×2 — (a) `adminBuildingConfig.ts` `.trim()` removal is intentional, documented strictness (`isHexColor` docstring rejects `'#fff '`); legacy-data leniency is a maintainer/data call, not an auto-fix on a main-bound branch. (b) the `useSubstituteShares.ts` "#2150" comment is a valid cross-ref (the merged retry-logic PR), not a typo. #2157 ×1 — the `_Last action` header was already bumped in `09d34c9` (thread outdated).
- Fixes pushed: 1
  - #2141 → `dev-paul` (188cf12) — `React.useId()` for the duplicate-term warning id. Verified: type-check ✓, lint ✓, `MatchingOrderingEditor.duplicateTerm`/`.memo` tests 11/11 ✓, prettier ✓. Sanctioned path: PR #2141 merges `dev-paul`→`main` and carried review comments. Push re-triggered CI — Build ✓ and type-check ✓ at log time, remaining checks in progress.
- Reviews posted: 1
  - #2141 — Ready with minor notes. Consolidated merge-readiness for the only main-bound PR. Flagged (non-blocking, inline): the Dock `SortableContext.items` array is still built from full `dockItems` while hidden folders/gated tools `return null`, so dnd-kit sort indices can skew — a complete fix filters `items` by both `shouldShowFolder` and `canAccessTool`, with a reorder-after-hidden test. Also flagged the one-time `shared_boards`/`expiresAt` live-data check before merge.
  - Refrained from re-reviewing #2155–#2166: each already carries a `gemini-code-assist` review plus prior-run structured reviews with resolved/answered threads; a second automated review this cycle would duplicate rather than add signal (harness frugality guidance).
- Notes:
  - Branch-safety: no push to `main` or any `dev-*` branch except the sanctioned `dev-paul` review-comment-fix path (#2141). This log commit is the only push to `scheduled-tasks`.
  - This run followed the 2026-07-07 run, which had already replied to / resolved the bulk of the open threads — so today's actionable surface was small (4 unanswered threads, 1 real fix).
  - Env runs Node 22 (repo pins 24); local type-check/lint/tests green. CI on Node 24 remains the authoritative gate.

## 2026-07-09

- PRs reviewed: 5 open PRs (all authored by OPS-PIvers, all base `dev-paul`)
  - #2171 — audit(scheduled-tasks): Thursday journals + skill fix (head `scheduled-tasks`, base `dev-paul`)
  - #2170 — docs(unifier): runs 29+30 memory log (head `nightly/unifier-log-2026-07-09`, base `dev-paul`)
  - #2169 — fix(D4): Organization/views imports → `@/` alias (head `nightly/unify-import-paths-2026-07-09`, base `dev-paul`)
  - #2168 — fix(D3): SettingsLabel group-heading retrofit (head `nightly/unify-settings-labels-2026-07-09`, base `dev-paul`)
  - #2167 — fix(D1): ExpectationsWidget empty state → ScaledEmptyState (head `nightly/unify-empty-states-2026-07-09`, base `dev-paul`)
- Comments processed: 2 unresolved threads (both on #2167, contradictory) — 1 fixed, 1 explained.
  - Fixed (1): #2167 — the committed `ScaledEmptyState` had color overrides (`titleClassName="text-slate-800"`, `iconClassName`/`subtitleClassName="text-slate-500"`) that render near-invisible on the transparent widget surface over the slate-900 dashboard and violate CLAUDE.md's muted-text-on-dark guidance. Dropped all three overrides so the component's dark-surface defaults (`text-slate-200`/`text-slate-300`) apply. Agreed with the `claude` reviewer thread over the contradictory `gemini-code-assist` thread.
  - Explained (1): #2167 — the `gemini-code-assist` thread asked for the opposite (darker overrides for a "light-themed widget"). Explained it's based on a false premise: the empty-state code path renders on a transparent `WidgetLayout` (no card) over the dashboard, not on the widget's white `bg-white` category cards (which only appear in the main view). No fix in that direction.
- Fixes pushed: 1
  - #2167 → `nightly/unify-empty-states-2026-07-09` (44816fe) — drop ScaledEmptyState color overrides. Verified: type-check ✓, lint ✓ (eslint --max-warnings 0 on the file), prettier ✓.
- Reviews posted: 5 (one structured review per open PR)
  - #2167 — Ready. Empty-state unification, container-scaling boundary preserved, review contrast concern resolved.
  - #2168 — Ready. Visual-neutral `SettingsLabel as="span"` + `role="group"`/`aria-labelledby` a11y fix; `SettingsLabel` confirmed to support the `as`/`id` props used.
  - #2169 — Ready. Pure `@/`-alias import-path equivalence swap across 8 Organization/views files.
  - #2170 — Ready with minor notes. Docs-only unifier log reconstruction; flagged a human sanity-check for residual duplicate rows.
  - #2171 — Ready. Docs/skill-only; skill-doc SpecialistSchedule correction matches real codebase layout. Non-blocking nit: `.claude/` mirror blockquote continuation line missing its `>` marker (renders fine via lazy continuation).
- Notes:
  - Branch-safety: no push to `main` or any `dev-*` branch. The only code push was to the non-protected feature branch `nightly/unify-empty-states-2026-07-09` (#2167). This log commit is the only push to `scheduled-tasks`.
  - #2167 carried two directly-contradictory reviewer threads; resolved by reading ground truth (`WidgetLayout` provides no background; `ScaledEmptyState` defaults are `text-slate-200`/`300`) rather than either reviewer's assertion.
  - Env runs Node 22 (repo pins 24); local type-check/lint/prettier green. CI on Node 24 remains the authoritative gate.

## 2026-07-10

- PRs reviewed: 2 open PRs (both authored by OPS-PIvers)
  - #2173 — docs(ai): document generateGuidedLearning admin-only + no-rate-limit design intent (head `scheduled-tasks`, base `dev-paul`, draft)
  - #2172 — Audit updates: fix skill freshness, unify import paths, and CSS adjustments (head `dev-paul`, base `main`)
- Comments processed: 6 total across both PRs — 0 fixed, 6 already-resolved/explained.
  - #2173 thread 1 (`docs/scheduled-tasks/ai-integration.md`) — reviewer flagged internal agent-scheduling triage reasoning in a completed audit entry. Already resolved by follow-up commit `9b64964` ("trim item-selection triage noise") before this run; the flagged "no HIGH anywhere… daily-before-weekly tiebreak" text is gone. Replied to close the loop. No new fix needed.
  - #2173 thread 2 (`functions/src/aiGeneration.ts:2087`) — reviewer nit claiming the `isExternalCaller` cross-reference points at a function with no docblock. Independently verified FALSE: `isExternalCaller` (line 179) has a JSDoc at lines 161–178 whose closing lines document the admin-exempt short-circuit. Owner already rebutted correctly at top-level. No change.
  - #2172 — all 4 review threads already carry owner replies (1 resolved: the ExpectationsWidget D1-E16 revert; 3 explained: TalkingTool `text-slate-400` on white card is correct, and two SKILL.md blockquote `>`-marker nits that are valid CommonMark lazy continuations / Prettier-canonical). Nothing outstanding.
- Fixes pushed: 0 (no branch required a code change this run — every actionable item was already resolved by a prior commit or reply).
- Reviews posted: 0 new structured reviews. Both PRs already carry two full verified `claude[bot]` reviews each plus Gemini/Copilot reviews, with all threads addressed; a third automated review would duplicate rather than add signal (harness frugality guidance). Independent re-verification of both diffs surfaced no new issues.
- Notes:
  - Branch-safety: no push to `main` or any `dev-*` branch. #2172 merges `dev-paul`→`main` and needed no fix (all comments already addressed), so the sanctioned `dev-paul` fix path went unused. This log commit is the only push to `scheduled-tasks`.
  - #2173 CI status: pending/none reported (draft PR).
  - Env runs Node 22 (repo pins 24); CI on Node 24 remains the authoritative gate.

## 2026-07-11

- PRs reviewed: 3 open PRs (all authored by OPS-PIvers, all draft, all base `dev-paul`)
  - #2176 — fix(css-scaling): scale QuizResults period-filter select with cqmin (head `scheduled-tasks`)
  - #2175 — docs(unifier): log nightly run 31 — 2026-07-11 (head `nightly/unifier-log-2026-07-11`)
  - #2174 — D4: use @/ alias for i18n locale imports (head `nightly/unify-import-paths-2026-07-11`)
- Comments processed: 0 change-requesting review comments. No inline review threads on any PR. Existing reviews were all non-actionable: `gemini-code-assist[bot]` "no feedback" summaries (+ its own sunsetting notice) on all three, and `claude[bot]` LGTM reviews on #2176 and #2174. No replies posted — none were questions or change requests, and harness guidance is to be frugal with GitHub replies.
- Fixes pushed: 0 (no PR carried an unresolved comment requiring a code fix).
- Reviews posted: 3 structured reviews (one per PR) — all **Ready**.
  - #2176 — Ready. Verified the fix against ground truth: QuizWidget has `skipScaling: true`; the wrapping `<div>` (`padding: min(8px,2cqmin) min(16px,4cqmin)`/`gap`) and sibling `<label>` (`fontSize: min(10px,3cqmin)`) were already scaled, so the `<select>` was genuinely the lone hardcoded outlier. `min(14px, 5.5cqmin)` is the correct body/form tier per CLAUDE.md. WON'T FIX on the ClockWidget hero cap is sound (jsdom `cssstyle` drops `min()`/`clamp()`, defeating the cqmin regression test; bare `cqmin` hero text is CLAUDE.md-endorsed).
  - #2175 — Ready. Doc-only unifier run-31 log; backlog-row hygiene fix (4 NEEDS REVIEW → CLOSED D1-E19–E22) correctly reconciles backlog vs exceptions tables. Zero code risk.
  - #2174 — Ready. Pure mechanical `@/` alias equivalence for 4 i18n locale imports; `@/` resolves to repo root in both `vite.config.ts` and `tsconfig.json`, same resolved modules.
- Notes:
  - Branch-safety: no push to `main` or any `dev-*` branch. No PR merged `dev-paul`→`main` this run, so the sanctioned `dev-paul` fix path went unused. This log commit is the only push to `scheduled-tasks`.

- Comments processed: 2 unresolved inline threads actioned — 0 fixed (no push needed), 2 explained + resolved. Every other PR's inline threads were already resolved / already carried author replies.
  - #2183: 2 unresolved-but-`is_outdated` `claude` threads asking to scope the "Color Presets" `id`/`aria-labelledby` per widget instance (duplicate-DOM-id when two drawing widgets are flipped simultaneously). Verified the fix is ALREADY on the branch — both are `` `drawing-color-presets-label-${widget.id}` ``. Replied once confirming and resolved both threads. No push.
  - All other PRs (#2185/#2184/#2182/#2181/#2180/#2179/#2178/#2177/#2176/#2175/#2174): no open actionable review threads (resolved-in-code, prior author replies, or gemini/claude non-actionable summaries).
- Fixes pushed: 0 (no PR carried an unresolved comment requiring a code fix; the one candidate on #2183 was already fixed in-branch).
- Reviews posted: 12 structured reviews (one per PR).
  - #2185 — Ready with minor notes. Doc-only run-32 log, stacked on the still-open #2175; flagged the merge-order dependency (merge #2175 first, or close it) to avoid the doc-duplication failure mode.
  - #2184 — Ready. Mechanical `@/` alias unification (12 imports) + matching narrowly-scoped `no-restricted-imports` rule mirroring the `plc/**` pattern.
  - #2183 — Ready. Accessibility-only `as="span"` group-heading retrofit; per-instance id scoping correctly handles the per-widget `DraggableWindow` render (the key detail).
  - #2182 — Ready. Doc-only debugger run-26 log; backlog cross-references shipped PRs correctly.
  - #2181 — Ready. Test-only race fix; polls the real downstream write instead of the `uploadFile` proxy, 0ms macrotask-deferred mock. Production code untouched.
  - #2180 — Ready. FR `plcDashboard` PLC→CAP fix (7 keys incl. a gender-agreement fix) + recursive-sweep regression test.
  - #2179 — Ready. One-line dedup fix bringing `useSyncedQuizGroups` in lockstep with its already-fixed VA sibling; removes a latent loading-hang + redundant listener.
  - #2178 — Ready. Completes `sessionRef` cancellation-guard coverage for the last 2 ImportWizard handlers, incl. stale-blank-tab cleanup; 3 new tests.
  - #2177 — Ready. Render-time `activeTab` resync (repo-sanctioned "adjust state while rendering") + `aria-pressed` a11y bonus; regression test asserts both highlight and ARIA state.
  - #2176 — Ready with minor notes. WorkSymbols per-building appearance defaults (validated `getAdminBuildingConfig` case + panel embedded in the dedicated modal) and QuizResults `<select>` cqmin scaling; two independent low-risk fixes, 4 new validation tests. `types.ts` change is purely additive (no `WidgetConfig`/`ConfigForWidget` impact); no `DashboardContext`/`WidgetRegistry` touch.
  - #2175 — Ready. Doc-only run-31 log; closes 4 stale D1 NEEDS-REVIEW backlog rows.
  - #2174 — Ready. Mechanical `@/` alias for 4 i18n locale imports.
- Notes:
  - Branch-safety: no push to `main` or any `dev-*` branch. No PR merged `dev-paul`→`main` this run, so the sanctioned `dev-paul` fix path went unused. This log commit is the only push to `scheduled-tasks`.
  - Merge-order flag: #2185 (run-32 log) is stacked on #2175 (run-31 log); both edit `docs/routines/unifier.md`. Merge #2175 first (then #2185 shrinks to the run-32 delta), or land only one — surfaced in both reviews.
  - No code fixes were pushed, so no local verification was required. All code PRs claim `pnpm run validate` + `build` green; CI on Node 24 remains the authoritative gate (env runs Node 22, repo pins 24).

## 2026-07-13

- PRs reviewed: 10 open PRs (all authored by OPS-PIvers, all draft). #2186 base `main` (head `dev-paul`, the promotion PR); all others base `dev-paul` with `nightly/*`, `scheduled-tasks`, or `fix/*` heads. No PR has a `main`/`dev-*` head requiring push, so all are in-scope for review; per branch-safety, `dev-paul` (head of #2186) and `main` remain push-read-only except the sanctioned review-comment-fix path on the promotion PR.
  - #2195 — docs(debugger): log nightly run 27 (head `nightly/debugger-log-2026-07-13`)
  - #2194 — fix(test:counts): extend silent-test-drop guard to the Firestore rules suite (head `nightly/build-tooling-2026-07-13`)
  - #2193 — fix(i18n): DE sidebar.nav.plcs + plc.errors PLC→PLG drift (head `nightly/admin-config-2026-07-13`)
  - #2192 — fix(useResultsTabWarnings): don't zero pending-write tally on a partial snapshot (head `nightly/state-data-2026-07-13`)
  - #2191 — fix(FolderSidebar): "All items" badge undercounts when items are filed into folders (head `nightly/dashboard-layout-2026-07-13`)
  - #2190 — fix(VideoActivityWidget): dedup per-question answers in Results teacher stats (head `nightly/widgets-2026-07-13`)
  - #2189 — fix: Prettier formatting drift in docs/routines/unifier.md (head `nightly/baseline-fix-2026-07-13`)
  - #2188 — audit + test-coverage action: Monday (journals + quizAudio tests) (head `scheduled-tasks`)
  - #2187 — fix(unifier): dedupe docs/routines/unifier.md after merge-commit corruption (head `fix/unifier-doc-dedup-2026-07-12`)
  - #2186 — Document admin-only design intent for generateGuidedLearning / WorkSymbols config + a11y + fixes (head `dev-paul`, base `main`) — dev-paul→main promotion
- Comments processed: 7 unresolved inline threads actioned — 0 fixed (no push needed), 7 explained. Every actionable suggestion was already implemented in-branch or was incorrect/not-applicable when verified against the current file state.
  - #2194: 2 threads. Gemini(high) "pass `rules` arg" + Claude "test description vs `main()` behavior" — BOTH already resolved on the branch (`test:rules` passes `rules`; `selectTargets` throws on unknown label + test/description corrected with a `claude[bot]` credit). Replied, no push.
  - #2192: 1 thread. Gemini(med) "remove redundant `Promise.resolve()` in `act()`" — DECLINED: the thenable return puts `act` in async mode so each hide/return cycle's effect flushes before the next, which is load-bearing for the in-flight-write race this test pins (corroborated by #2195's own run notes). Replied, no push.
  - #2190: 1 thread. Gemini(med) lookup-optimization — already fully implemented in the current file (single-loop accuracy, `Map`-based count). Replied, no push.
  - #2188: 2 threads. Claude `toBe(2)` — already applied. Gemini css-scaling.md line refs (`:989/:1069`) — verified INCORRECT against the branch; the doc's existing `:983/:1061` matches `PageEditorOverlay.tsx` exactly (confirmed via `git show`). Replied to both, no push.
  - #2186: 5 threads, 4 already carried author replies (WorkSymbols `global` sentinel refutation, empty-`selectedBuildingId` guard, label `htmlFor`/`id` a11y, unifier.md dedup via #2187). The 1 unanswered Claude thread (TalkingTool `aria-pressed` → `role="tab"`) EXPLAINED as a non-blocking a11y follow-up. Replied.
  - #2195/#2193/#2191/#2189/#2187: no open review threads.
- Fixes pushed: 0 (no PR carried an unresolved comment requiring a code fix; every candidate was already resolved in-branch or non-actionable).
- Reviews posted: 10 structured reviews (one per PR).
  - #2195 — Ready with minor notes. Doc-only run-27 log; flagged `unifier.md` merge-order coordination with #2189/#2187.
  - #2194 — Ready. Extends the test-count guard to the rules suite; `optional: true` correctly keeps `validate`/`test:all` green while still failing loud on missing required reports. 4 new unit tests.
  - #2193 — Ready. DE PLC→PLG terminology fix (11 keys) with a correctly-scoped (`plc.errors` + `sidebar.nav.plcs`) recursive-scan test.
  - #2192 — Ready. Snapshot-reconciliation race fix on the anti-cheating lockout path; reduces pending tally only by the confirmed delta. Regression test verified fail-before/pass-after.
  - #2191 — Ready. Sums all `itemCounts` buckets for the "All items" badge (was root-only); GL undercount limitation correctly logged as backlog. 3-case test.
  - #2190 — Ready. First-occurrence dedup extracted to a tested pure module, matching the codebase's established dedup-fence pattern. 7-case test.
  - #2189 — Ready. Formatting-only baseline unblock; land before sibling nightly PRs.
  - #2188 — Ready. Monday audit journals + new `quizAudio.test.ts` (13 tests); no production code.
  - #2187 — Ready. Restores `unifier.md` after a merge-artifact duplication; suggested a lightweight duplicate-header/row-count CI guard as follow-up given this is the 3rd occurrence.
  - #2186 — Ready with minor notes. Promotion PR bundling a feature + 3 fixes + a refactor; all threads addressed. Suggested a focused test for the new `WorkSymbolsConfigurationPanel` and preferring narrower integration PRs. `types.ts`/admin changes checked: additive config, correct admin-level placement, no new Firestore collection (so no `firestore.rules` change needed).
- Notes:
  - Branch-safety: no push to `main` or any `dev-*` branch. This log commit is the only push to `scheduled-tasks` (which also rides into open PR #2188).
  - Merge-order flag: #2189, #2195, and #2187 all touch `docs/routines/unifier.md`. Sequence deliberately (or land one) to avoid the recurring doc-merge concatenation artifact #2187 was created to repair.
  - Recurring failure class: `unifier.md` has now hit merge-corruption 3× — a small CI check (duplicate `Run count:` header / Run Log row-count floor) would catch it mechanically; surfaced in #2187's review.
  - No code fixes were pushed, so no local verification was required. All code PRs claim `pnpm run validate` + `build` green; CI on Node 24 remains the authoritative gate (this env runs Node 22, repo pins 24).

## 2026-07-16

- PRs reviewed: 5 open PRs (all authored by OPS-PIvers, all draft except #2217).
  - #2221 — audit(thursday) + fix(deps): journals + `flatted` DoS/proto-pollution override (head `scheduled-tasks`, base `dev-paul`)
  - #2220 — docs(unifier): log nightly run 35 (head `nightly/unifier-log-2026-07-16`, base `dev-paul`)
  - #2219 — Unify ActivityWall library empty state onto ScaledEmptyState (head `nightly/unify-empty-states-2026-07-16`, base `dev-paul`)
  - #2218 — Retrofit MusicWidget "Layout" label to group-heading SettingsLabel (head `nightly/unify-settings-labels-2026-07-16`, base `dev-paul`)
  - #2217 — Audit results and fixes for widget registry, linting, and i18n (head `dev-paul`, base `main`) — dev-paul→main promotion
- Comments processed: 3 unresolved inline threads on #2217 (gemini-code-assist) — 1 fixed + pushed, 2 explained (no fix). All other PRs (#2221/#2220/#2219/#2218) had zero review threads.
  - #2217 quiz path (`TeacherDiscoveryRoute.tsx:418`): gemini(med) optional-chaining guard on `quizData.questions`. VALID — `loadQuizData` returns the raw Drive JSON blob with no normalizer, so a malformed/legacy file can yield undefined `questions` → `quizMaxPoints(undefined)` throws. Fixed with `quizData?.questions ? quizMaxPoints(quizData.questions) : 100` (100 matches the helper's own empty-set denominator). Pushed to `dev-paul` (d44cef9); verified type-check ✓ lint ✓ format ✓ + `TeacherDiscoveryRoute.test.tsx` (2 tests) ✓. Replied + this is the sanctioned dev-paul review-comment-fix path.
  - #2217 VA path (`:561`): gemini(med) same guard for `activityData.questions`. DECLINED — `loadActivityData` normalizes via `normalizeVideoActivityQuestions(raw.questions)` = `(qs ?? []).map(...)`, guaranteeing a defined array; the guard would be dead code. Replied.
  - #2217 GuidedLearning (`GuidedLearningManager.tsx:449`): gemini(med) `buildingSets && buildingSets.length` guard. DECLINED — `buildingSets` is a required non-optional prop already dereferenced unguarded via `.map()` at lines 304/456; the guard would be redundant and locally inconsistent. Replied.
- Fixes pushed: 1
  - #2217 / `dev-paul` (d44cef9) — guard quiz-attach `maxPoints` against unvalidated Drive JSON (`quizData?.questions ? … : 100`).
- Reviews posted: 5 structured reviews (one per PR).
  - #2221 — Ready. Dev-only `flatted` override (^3.4.2) closing 2 advisories via the eslint chain; minimal lockfile diff. Flagged the newly-logged `pnpm audit` HTTP 410 (CVE scanning currently blind) as a maintainer follow-up (Dependabot/osv-scanner).
  - #2220 — Ready. Docs-only unifier run-35 log; large add/del count is expected in-place log rewrite churn.
  - #2219 — Ready with minor notes. ScaledEmptyState conversion with a correctly-scoped `container-type: size` boundary on the empty-state arm only; two intentional canonical deltas (uppercase/tracked title, cqmin constants). Per the PR's own visual-risk tag, recommended a one-glance preview check.
  - #2218 — Ready. Mechanical `as="span"` group-heading a11y retrofit; per-instance `${widget.id}` id scoping correct for per-widget render.
  - #2217 — Ready with minor notes. dev-paul→main rollup; the one actionable reviewer comment resolved. `types.ts` change is a pure widening (`RevealGridConfig.fontFamily` → `string`), no `WidgetType`/registry impact. `firestore.rules` moderation-bypass fix is sound and tested; noted the added second `get()` on the session doc (well under the per-request access-call limit).
- Notes:
  - Branch-safety: no push to `main` or any `dev-*` head EXCEPT the sanctioned path — #2217 merges `dev-paul`→`main` and carried unresolved review comments, so the one code fix was pushed to `dev-paul` per the standing rule. No other `dev-*`/`main` push.
  - Verification env runs Node 22 (repo pins 24, "Unsupported engine" warning); type-check/lint/format/tests all still ran green locally. CI on Node 24 remains the authoritative gate.
  - This review-log commit is on the designated `claude/compassionate-shannon-ijvfgq` branch (where prior runs' pr-review-log.md already lives), not `scheduled-tasks` — avoids polluting the unrelated open PR #2221 and honors the branch-safety directive.

## 2026-07-18

- PRs reviewed: 6 open PRs (all authored by OPS-PIvers).
  - #2231 — docs(debugger): log nightly run 29 (head `nightly/debugger-log-2026-07-18`, base `dev-paul`)
  - #2230 — fix(gcPlcOrphans): paginate PLC/synced-group sweeps past the first page (head `nightly/build-tooling-2026-07-18`, base `dev-paul`)
  - #2229 — fix(i18n): ES `sidebar.nav.plcs` + `plc.errors` PLC→Comunidad (head `nightly/admin-config-2026-07-18`, base `dev-paul`)
  - #2228 — fix(FolderTree): dismiss the folder overflow menu on outside click/Escape (head `nightly/dashboard-layout-2026-07-18`, base `dev-paul`)
  - #2227 — fix(Countdown): parse bare-date startDate/eventDate as local noon (head `nightly/widgets-2026-07-18`, base `dev-paul`)
  - #2226 — audit(friday): daily/weekly journals (head `scheduled-tasks`, base `dev-paul`)
- Comments processed: 2 total — 0 fixed (both already self-resolved on-branch), 2 replied to close the loop. The 14 threads on #2226 were left to the concurrent session actively iterating that branch (see notes).
  - #2227 (`Countdown/Widget.test.tsx`): claude[bot] flagged the mid-process `process.env.TZ` override as a possible false-positive regression guard. ALREADY ADDRESSED on-branch in commit `759fa9d` — `parseConfigDate` was extracted to `components/widgets/Countdown/utils.ts` and now has a pure, timezone-independent unit test (`new Date(y,m,d,12).getHours() === 12`), exactly the reviewer's preferred fix; the integration test switched to `vi.stubEnv('TZ', …)`. Replied confirming; no code change needed.
  - #2230 (`functions/src/gcPlcOrphans.ts`): claude[bot] flagged a missing `MAX_GROUPS_PER_RUN` ceiling warning in the two group loops (asymmetry with the PLC loop). ALREADY ADDRESSED on-branch in commit `a4bbc1b` — both group loops now `console.warn` on hitting the ceiling (lines 275–277, 404–406). Replied confirming; no code change needed.
  - #2226: 14 inline threads (claude[bot] + gemini-code-assist) on an actively-iterated BuildingSelector-unification branch. Most are `is_outdated` with existing "already applied" author replies; the live ones concern roving-tabindex/aria edge cases that the concurrent session was still committing to as of 05:40 today. Left untouched to avoid colliding with in-flight work; no fresh automated review posted there (would duplicate the existing review load).
- Fixes pushed: 0 — both actionable review comments were already resolved by later commits on their own branches before this run; nothing required a new push.
- Reviews posted: 5 structured reviews (one each on #2227, #2228, #2229, #2230, #2231; #2226 skipped — already under active multi-reviewer iteration).
  - #2227 — Ready. Contained bare-date parsing fix via a shared `parseConfigDate` helper at all 4 call sites; full-ISO values still fall through unchanged. Pure + integration regression coverage; the one review comment is resolved.
  - #2228 — Ready. Outside-click + Escape dismissal on `FolderRow`'s overflow menu, reusing the established `useClickOutside` + `isEscapeFromWidgetInput` pattern from `SidebarPlcs.PlcRow`. Live surface (Quiz/VA/GL/MiniApp managers); both dismissal paths tested.
  - #2229 — Ready. Pure ES locale terminology swap (PLC→Comunidad) across `sidebar.nav.plcs` + 10 `plc.errors` keys, with a scoped recursive regression test that avoids the intentionally-untranslated `admin.plc.recovery` namespace. FR/`plcRoute`/`plcDirectory` siblings correctly deferred to backlog.
  - #2230 — Ready. Cursor-based pagination on all 3 `gcPlcOrphans` scans fixes a real silent starvation bug (any doc past the first page was never swept); mirrors the validated `plcWeeklyDigest` pattern, ceiling warnings added, page-crossing regression tests included.
  - #2231 — Ready. Docs-only debugger run-29 log; backlog checkoffs cross-reference their fixing PRs (#1976, #2211), and the two notes captured from the #2227/#2230 claude[bot] reviews are reusable lessons.
- Notes:
  - Branch-safety: no push to `main` or any `dev-*` branch. No code fixes were pushed at all this run (both review comments were already resolved on-branch). This review-log commit is on the designated `claude/compassionate-shannon-mdzg3t` branch — matching the prior-run precedent of keeping the log off `scheduled-tasks` (which is the head of the actively-iterated open PR #2226) to avoid polluting an unrelated PR and honor the branch-safety directive. The designated branch was rebuilt from the latest `origin/dev-paul` (it previously carried only already-merged dev-paul→main merge commits) so the log PR is a clean single-file diff.
  - Verification env runs Node 22 (repo pins 24, "Unsupported engine" warning). No fixes pushed, so no local verification was required; all 4 code PRs claim `pnpm run validate` + `build` green, and CI on Node 24 remains the authoritative gate.
