## 2025-02-23 - Memoizing Context Dependencies

**Learning:** Functions created in the body of a component (like `handleDragStart`, `handleDragEnd`, and `customCollisionDetection`) change references on every render. If these functions are passed into complex context providers like `DndContext`, they can trigger deep re-renders of the entire drag-and-drop tree and all child components even if other props remain unchanged.
**Action:** When implementing complex interaction wrappers (like `@dnd-kit/core` contexts), always use `useCallback` on the event handlers passed to them to preserve stable object references and prevent unnecessary cascading re-renders.
